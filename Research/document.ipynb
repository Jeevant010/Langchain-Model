They branded this technique “Deep Learning.” Training a deep neural net\\nwas widely considered impossible at the time,2 and most researchers had abandoned\\nthe idea since the 1990s. This paper revived the interest of the scientific community\\nand before long many new papers demonstrated that Deep Learning was not only\\npossible, but capable of mind-blowing achievements that no other Machine Learning\\n(ML) technique could hope to match (with the help of tremendous computing power\\nand great amounts of data). This enthusiasm soon extended to many other areas of\\nMachine Learning.\\nFast-forward 10 years and Machine Learning has conquered the industry: it is now at\\nthe heart of much of the magic in today’s high-tech products, ranking your web\\nsearch results, powering your smartphone’s speech recognition, and recommending\\nvideos, beating the world champion at the game of Go.

But Machine Learning is not\\njust a futuristic fantasy, it’s already here. In fact, it has been around for decades in\\nsome specialized applications, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). But the\\nfirst ML application that really became mainstream, improving the lives of hundreds\\nof millions of people, took over the world back in the 1990s: it was the spam filter.\\nNot exactly a self-aware Skynet, but it does technically qualify as Machine Learning\\n(it has actually learned so well that you seldom need to flag an email as spam any‐\\nmore). It was followed by hundreds of ML applications that now quietly power hun‐\\ndreds of products and features that you use regularly, from better recommendations\\nto voice search.\\nWhere does Machine Learning start and where does it end? What exactly does it\\nmean for a machine to learn something? If I download a copy of Wikipedia, has my\\ncomputer really “learned” something? Is it suddenly smarter? In this chapter we will\\nstart by clarifying what Machine Learning is and why you may want to use it.\\nThen, before we set out to explore the Machine Learning continent, we will take a\\nlook at the map and learn about the main regions and the most notable landmarks:\\nsupervised versus unsupervised learning, online versus batch learning, instance-\\nbased versus model-based learning. Then we will look at the workflow of a typical ML\\nproject, discuss the main challenges you may face, and cover how to evaluate and\\nfine-tune a Machine Learning system.\\nThis chapter introduces a lot of fundamental concepts (and jargon) that every data\\nscientist should know by heart. It will be a high-level overview (the only chapter\\nwithout much code), all rather simple, but you should make sure everything is\\ncrystal-clear to you before continuing to the rest of the book.

If you are not sure, try to answer all\\nthe questions listed at the end of the chapter before moving on.\\nWhat Is Machine Learning?\\nMachine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can\\nlearn from data.\\nHere is a slightly more general definition:\\n[Machine Learning is the] field of study that gives computers the ability to learn\\nwithout being explicitly programmed.\\n—Arthur Samuel, 1959\\nAnd a more engineering-oriented one:\\nA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T\\nand some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves\\nwith experience E.\\n—Tom Mitchell, 1997\\nFor example, your spam filter is a Machine Learning program that can learn to flag\\nspam given examples of spam emails (e.g., flagged by users) and examples of regular\\n(nonspam, also called “ham”) emails. The examples that the system uses to learn are\\ncalled the training set. Each training example is called a training instance (or sample).\\nIn this case, the task T is to flag spam for new emails, the experience E is the training\\ndata, and the performance measure P needs to be defined; for example, you can use\\nthe ratio of correctly classified emails. This particular performance measure is called\\naccuracy and it is often used in classification tasks.\\nIf you just download a copy of Wikipedia, your computer has a lot more data, but it is\\nnot suddenly better at any task. Thus, it is not Machine Learning.\\nWhy Use Machine Learning?\\nConsider how you would write a spam filter using traditional programming techni‐\\nques (Figure 1-1):\\n1. First you would look at what spam typically looks like. You might notice that\\nsome words or phrases (such as “4U,” “credit card,” “free,” and “amazing”) tend to\\ncome up a lot in the subject. Perhaps you would also notice a few other patterns\\nin the sender’s name, the email’s body, and so on.\\n4 \\n| \\nChapter 1: The Machine Learning Landscape\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Automatically adapting to change\\nAnother area where Machine Learning shines is for problems that either are too com‐\\nplex for traditional approaches or have no known algorithm. For example, consider \\nspeech recognition: say you want to start simple and write a program capable of dis‐\\ntinguishing the words “one” and “two.” You might notice that the word “two” starts\\nwith a high-pitch sound (“T”), so you could hardcode an algorithm that measures\\nhigh-pitch sound intensity and use that to distinguish ones and twos. Obviously this\\ntechnique will not scale to thousands of words spoken by millions of very different\\npeople in noisy environments and in dozens of languages. The best solution (at least\\ntoday) is to write an algorithm that learns by itself, given many example recordings\\nfor each word.\\nFinally, Machine Learning can help humans learn (Figure 1-4): ML algorithms can be\\ninspected to see what they have learned (although for some algorithms this can be\\ntricky). For instance, once the spam filter has been trained on enough spam, it can\\neasily be inspected to reveal the list of words and combinations of words that it\\nbelieves are the best predictors of spam. Sometimes this will reveal unsuspected cor‐\\nrelations or new trends, and thereby lead to a better understanding of the problem.\\nApplying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover patterns\\nthat were not immediately apparent.

You may also want to monitor the input data and react to\\nabnormal data (e.g., using an anomaly detection algorithm).\\nInstance-Based Versus Model-Based Learning\\nOne more way to categorize Machine Learning systems is by how they generalize.\\nMost Machine Learning tasks are about making predictions. This means that given a\\nnumber of training examples, the system needs to be able to generalize to examples it\\nhas never seen before. Having a good performance measure on the training data is\\ngood, but insufficient; the true goal is to perform well on new instances.\\nThere are two main approaches to generalization: instance-based learning and\\nmodel-based learning.\\nInstance-based learning\\nPossibly the most trivial form of learning is simply to learn by heart. If you were to\\ncreate a spam filter this way, it would just flag all emails that are identical to emails\\nthat have already been flagged by users—not the worst solution, but certainly not the\\nbest.\\nInstead of just flagging emails that are identical to known spam emails, your spam\\nfilter could be programmed to also flag emails that are very similar to known spam\\nemails. This requires a measure of similarity between two emails. A (very basic) simi‐\\nlarity measure between two emails could be to count the number of words they have\\nin common. The system would flag an email as spam if it has many words in com‐\\nmon with a known spam email.\\nThis is called instance-based learning: the system learns the examples by heart, then\\ngeneralizes to new cases using a similarity measure (Figure 1-15).\\nFigure 1-15.

Again, this\\nintroduces a sampling bias, by ruling out people who don’t care much about poli‐\\ntics, people who don’t like the Literary Digest, and other key groups. This is a spe‐\\ncial type of sampling bias called nonresponse bias.\\nHere is another example: say you want to build a system to recognize funk music vid‐\\neos. One way to build your training set is to search “funk music” on YouTube and use\\nthe resulting videos. But this assumes that YouTube’s search engine returns a set of\\nvideos that are representative of all the funk music videos on YouTube. In reality, the\\nsearch results are likely to be biased toward popular artists (and if you live in Brazil\\nyou will get a lot of “funk carioca” videos, which sound nothing like James Brown).\\nOn the other hand, how else can you get a large training set?\\nPoor-Quality Data\\nObviously, if your training data is full of errors, outliers, and noise (e.g., due to poor-\\nquality measurements), it will make it harder for the system to detect the underlying\\npatterns, so your system is less likely to perform well. It is often well worth the effort\\nto spend time cleaning up your training data. The truth is, most data scientists spend\\na significant part of their time doing just that. For example:\\n• If some instances are clearly outliers, it may help to simply discard them or try to\\nfix the errors manually.\\n• If some instances are missing a few features (e.g., 5% of your customers did not\\nspecify their age), you must decide whether you want to ignore this attribute alto‐\\ngether, ignore these instances, fill in the missing values (e.g., with the median\\nage), or train one model with the feature and one model without it, and so on.\\nIrrelevant Features\\nAs the saying goes: garbage in, garbage out. Your system will only be capable of learn‐\\ning if the training data contains enough relevant features and not too many irrelevant\\nones. A critical part of the success of a Machine Learning project is coming up with a\\ngood set of features to train on.

You might be\\ntempted to say that all taxi drivers in that country are thieves. Overgeneralizing is\\nsomething that we humans do all too often, and unfortunately machines can fall into\\nthe same trap if we are not careful.

Even though it performs much better on the\\ntraining data than the simple linear model, would you really trust its predictions?\\nFigure 1-22. Overfitting the training data\\nComplex models such as deep neural networks can detect subtle patterns in the data,\\nbut if the training set is noisy, or if it is too small (which introduces sampling noise),\\nthen the model is likely to detect patterns in the noise itself. Obviously these patterns\\nwill not generalize to new instances. For example, say you feed your life satisfaction\\nmodel many more attributes, including uninformative ones such as the country’s\\nname. In that case, a complex model may detect patterns like the fact that all coun‐\\ntries in the training data with a w in their name have a life satisfaction greater than 7:\\nNew Zealand (7.3), Norway (7.4), Sweden (7.2), and Switzerland (7.5).

Obviously\\nthis pattern occurred in the training data by pure chance, but the model has no way\\nto tell whether a pattern is real or simply the result of noise in the data.\\nOverfitting happens when the model is too complex relative to the\\namount and noisiness of the training data. The possible solutions\\nare:\\n• To simplify the model by selecting one with fewer parameters\\n(e.g., a linear model rather than a high-degree polynomial\\nmodel), by reducing the number of attributes in the training\\ndata or by constraining the model\\n• To gather more training data\\n• To reduce the noise in the training data (e.g., fix data errors\\nand remove outliers)\\nConstraining a model to make it simpler and reduce the risk of overfitting is called\\nregularization. For example, the linear model we defined earlier has two parameters,\\nθ0 and θ1. This gives the learning algorithm two degrees of freedom to adapt the model\\nto the training data: it can tweak both the height (θ0) and the slope (θ1) of the line. If\\nwe forced θ1 = 0, the algorithm would have only one degree of freedom and would\\nhave a much harder time fitting the data properly: all it could do is move the line up\\nor down to get as close as possible to the training instances, so it would end up\\naround the mean. A very simple model indeed! If we allow the algorithm to modify θ1\\nbut we force it to keep it small, then the learning algorithm will effectively have some‐\\nwhere in between one and two degrees of freedom. It will produce a simpler model\\nthan with two degrees of freedom, but more complex than with just one. You want to\\nfind the right balance between fitting the data perfectly and keeping the model simple\\nenough to ensure that it will generalize well.\\nFigure 1-23 shows three models: the dotted line represents the original model that\\nwas trained with a few countries missing, the dashed line is our second model trained\\nwith all countries, and the solid line is a linear model trained with the same data as\\nthe first model but with a regularization constraint.

Regularization reduces the risk of overfitting\\nThe amount of regularization to apply during learning can be controlled by a hyper‐\\nparameter. A hyperparameter is a parameter of a learning algorithm (not of the\\nmodel). As such, it is not affected by the learning algorithm itself; it must be set prior\\nto training and remains constant during training. If you set the regularization hyper‐\\nparameter to a very large value, you will get an almost flat model (a slope close to\\nzero); the learning algorithm will almost certainly not overfit the training data, but it\\nwill be less likely to find a good solution. Tuning hyperparameters is an important\\npart of building a Machine Learning system (you will see a detailed example in the\\nnext chapter).\\nUnderfitting the Training Data\\nAs you might guess, underfitting is the opposite of overfitting: it occurs when your\\nmodel is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data. For example, a lin‐\\near model of life satisfaction is prone to underfit; reality is just more complex than\\nthe model, so its predictions are bound to be inaccurate, even on the training exam‐\\nples.\\nThe main options to fix this problem are:\\n• Selecting a more powerful model, with more parameters\\n• Feeding better features to the learning algorithm (feature engineering)\\n• Reducing the constraints on the model (e.g., reducing the regularization hyper‐\\nparameter)\\nStepping Back\\nBy now you already know a lot about Machine Learning.

Wolperts (1996).\\nSo evaluating a model is simple enough: just use a test set. Now suppose you are hesi‐\\ntating between two models (say a linear model and a polynomial model): how can\\nyou decide? One option is to train both and compare how well they generalize using\\nthe test set.\\nNow suppose that the linear model generalizes better, but you want to apply some \\nregularization to avoid overfitting. The question is: how do you choose the value of\\nthe regularization hyperparameter? One option is to train 100 different models using\\n100 different values for this hyperparameter. Suppose you find the best hyperparame‐\\nter value that produces a model with the lowest generalization error, say just 5% error.\\nSo you launch this model into production, but unfortunately it does not perform as\\nwell as expected and produces 15% errors. What just happened?\\nThe problem is that you measured the generalization error multiple times on the test\\nset, and you adapted the model and hyperparameters to produce the best model for\\nthat set. This means that the model is unlikely to perform as well on new data.\\nA common solution to this problem is to have a second holdout set called the valida‐\\ntion set. You train multiple models with various hyperparameters using the training\\nset, you select the model and hyperparameters that perform best on the validation set,\\nand when you’re happy with your model you run a single final test against the test set\\nto get an estimate of the generalization error.\\nTo avoid “wasting” too much training data in validation sets, a common technique is\\nto use cross-validation: the training set is split into complementary subsets, and each\\nmodel is trained against a different combination of these subsets and validated\\nagainst the remaining parts. Once the model type and hyperparameters have been\\nselected, a final model is trained using these hyperparameters on the full training set,\\nand the generalized error is measured on the test set.\\nNo Free Lunch Theorem\\nA model is a simplified version of the observations. The simplifications are meant to\\ndiscard the superfluous details that are unlikely to generalize to new instances. How‐\\never, to decide what data to discard and what data to keep, you must make assump‐\\ntions. For example, a linear model makes the assumption that the data is\\nfundamentally linear and that the distance between the instances and the straight line\\nis just noise, which can safely be ignored.\\nIn a famous 1996 paper,11 David Wolpert demonstrated that if you make absolutely\\nno assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any\\nother.

A Machine Learning pipeline for real estate investments\\nPipelines\\nA sequence of data processing components is called a data pipeline. Pipelines are very\\ncommon in Machine Learning systems, since there is a lot of data to manipulate and\\nmany data transformations to apply.\\nComponents typically run asynchronously. Each component pulls in a large amount\\nof data, processes it, and spits out the result in another data store, and then some time\\nlater the next component in the pipeline pulls this data and spits out its own output,\\nand so on. Each component is fairly self-contained: the interface between components\\nis simply the data store. This makes the system quite simple to grasp (with the help of\\na data flow graph), and different teams can focus on different components. Moreover,\\nif a component breaks down, the downstream components can often continue to run\\nnormally (at least for a while) by just using the last output from the broken compo‐\\nnent. This makes the architecture quite robust.\\nOn the other hand, a broken component can go unnoticed for some time if proper\\nmonitoring is not implemented. The data gets stale and the overall system’s perfor‐\\nmance drops.\\nThe next question to ask is what the current solution looks like (if any). It will often\\ngive you a reference performance, as well as insights on how to solve the problem.\\nYour boss answers that the district housing prices are currently estimated manually\\nby experts: a team gathers up-to-date information about a district (excluding median\\nhousing prices), and they use complex rules to come up with an estimate. This is\\ncostly and time-consuming, and their estimates are not great; their typical error rate\\nis about 15%.\\nOkay, with all this information you are now ready to start designing your system.\\nFirst, you need to frame the problem: is it supervised, unsupervised, or Reinforce‐\\nment Learning?

Before you read on, pause and\\ntry to answer these questions for yourself.\\nHave you found the answers? Let’s see: it is clearly a typical supervised learning task\\nsince you are given labeled training examples (each instance comes with the expected\\noutput, i.e., the district’s median housing price). Moreover, it is also a typical regres‐\\nsion task, since you are asked to predict a value. More specifically, this is a multivari‐\\nate regression problem since the system will use multiple features to make a prediction\\n(it will use the district’s population, the median income, etc.). In the first chapter, you\\npredicted life satisfaction based on just one feature, the GDP per capita, so it was a\\nunivariate regression problem. Finally, there is no continuous flow of data coming in\\nthe system, there is no particular need to adjust to changing data rapidly, and the data\\nis small enough to fit in memory, so plain batch learning should do just fine.\\nIf the data was huge, you could either split your batch learning\\nwork across multiple servers (using the MapReduce technique, as\\nwe will see later), or you could use an online learning technique\\ninstead.\\nSelect a Performance Measure\\nYour next step is to select a performance measure. A typical performance measure for\\nregression problems is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). It measures the standard\\ndeviation4 of the errors the system makes in its predictions. For example, an RMSE\\nequal to 50,000 means that about 68% of the system’s predictions fall within $50,000\\nof the actual value, and about 95% of the predictions fall within $100,000 of the actual\\nvalue.5 Equation 2-1 shows the mathematical formula to compute the RMSE.\\nEquation 2-1.

After all,\\nyou have only taken a quick glance at the data, and surely you should learn a whole\\nlot more about it before you decide what algorithms to use, right? This is true, but\\nyour brain is an amazing pattern detection system, which means that it is highly\\nprone to overfitting: if you look at the test set, you may stumble upon some seemingly\\ninteresting pattern in the test data that leads you to select a particular kind of\\nMachine Learning model. When you estimate the generalization error using the test\\nset, your estimate will be too optimistic and you will launch a system that will not\\nperform as well as expected.

This introduces some unfortunate sampling bias.\\nBut both these solutions will break next time you fetch an updated dataset. A com‐\\nmon solution is to use each instance’s identifier to decide whether or not it should go\\nin the test set (assuming instances have a unique and immutable identifier). For\\nexample, you could compute a hash of each instance’s identifier, keep only the last\\nbyte of the hash, and put the instance in the test set if this value is lower or equal to\\n51 (~20% of 256). This ensures that the test set will remain consistent across multiple\\nruns, even if you refresh the dataset. The new test set will contain 20% of the new\\ninstances, but it will not contain any instance that was previously in the training set.\\nHere is a possible implementation:\\nimport hashlib\\ndef test_set_check(identifier, test_ratio, hash):\\n    return hash(np.int64(identifier)).digest()[-1] < 256 * test_ratio\\ndef split_train_test_by_id(data, test_ratio, id_column, hash=hashlib.md5):\\n    ids = data[id_column]\\n    in_test_set = ids.apply(lambda id_: test_set_check(id_, test_ratio, hash))\\n    return data.loc[~in_test_set], data.loc[in_test_set]\\nUnfortunately, the housing dataset does not have an identifier column. The simplest\\nsolution is to use the row index as the ID:\\nhousing_with_id = housing.reset_index()   # adds an `index` column\\ntrain_set, test_set = split_train_test_by_id(housing_with_id, 0.2, \"index\")\\nIf you use the row index as a unique identifier, you need to make sure that new data\\ngets appended to the end of the dataset, and no row ever gets deleted. If this is not\\npossible, then you can try to use the most stable features to build a unique identifier.\\nFor example, a district’s latitude and longitude are guaranteed to be stable for a few\\nmillion years, so you could combine them into an ID like so:14\\nhousing_with_id[\"id\"] = housing[\"longitude\"] * 1000 + housing[\"latitude\"]\\ntrain_set, test_set = split_train_test_by_id(housing_with_id, 0.2, \"id\")\\nScikit-Learn provides a few functions to split datasets into multiple subsets in various\\nways. The simplest function is train_test_split, which does pretty much the same\\nthing as the function split_train_test defined earlier, with a couple of additional\\nfeatures. First there is a random_state parameter that allows you to set the random\\ngenerator seed as explained previously, and second you can pass it multiple datasets\\nwith an identical number of rows, and it will split them on the same indices (this is\\nvery useful, for example, if you have a separate DataFrame for labels):\\n50 \\n| \\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

If you want to\\nput it back into a Pandas DataFrame, it’s simple:\\nhousing_tr = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=housing_num.columns)\\nScikit-Learn Design\\nScikit-Learn’s API is remarkably well designed. The main design principles are:16\\n• Consistency. All objects share a consistent and simple interface:\\n— Estimators. Any object that can estimate some parameters based on a dataset\\nis called an estimator (e.g., an imputer is an estimator). The estimation itself is\\nperformed by the fit() method, and it takes only a dataset as a parameter (or\\ntwo for supervised learning algorithms; the second dataset contains the\\nlabels). Any other parameter needed to guide the estimation process is con‐\\nsidered a hyperparameter (such as an imputer’s strategy), and it must be set\\nas an instance variable (generally via a constructor parameter).\\n— Transformers. Some estimators (such as an imputer) can also transform a\\ndataset; these are called transformers. Once again, the API is quite simple: the\\ntransformation is performed by the transform() method with the dataset to\\ntransform as a parameter. It returns the transformed dataset. This transforma‐\\ntion generally relies on the learned parameters, as is the case for an imputer.\\nAll transformers also have a convenience method called fit_transform() \\nPrepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms \\n| \\n61\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Finally, some estimators are capable of making predictions given a\\ndataset; they are called predictors. For example, the LinearRegression model \\nin the previous chapter was a predictor: it predicted life satisfaction given a\\ncountry’s GDP per capita. A predictor has a predict() method that takes a\\ndataset of new instances and returns a dataset of corresponding predictions. It\\nalso has a score() method that measures the quality of the predictions given\\na test set (and the corresponding labels in the case of supervised learning\\nalgorithms).17\\n• Inspection. All the estimator’s hyperparameters are accessible directly via public\\ninstance variables (e.g., imputer.strategy), and all the estimator’s learned\\nparameters are also accessible via public instance variables with an underscore\\nsuffix (e.g., imputer.statistics_).\\n• Nonproliferation of classes. Datasets are represented as NumPy arrays or SciPy\\nsparse matrices, instead of homemade classes. Hyperparameters are just regular\\nPython strings or numbers.\\n• Composition. Existing building blocks are reused as much as possible. For\\nexample, it is easy to create a Pipeline estimator from an arbitrary sequence of\\ntransformers followed by a final estimator, as we will see.\\n• Sensible defaults.

You can look\\nat the mapping that this encoder has learned using the classes_ attribute (“<1H\\nOCEAN” is mapped to 0, “INLAND” is mapped to 1, etc.):\\n>>> print(encoder.classes_)\\n['<1H OCEAN' 'INLAND' 'ISLAND' 'NEAR BAY' 'NEAR OCEAN']\\nOne issue with this representation is that ML algorithms will assume that two nearby\\nvalues are more similar than two distant values. Obviously this is not the case (for\\nexample, categories 0 and 4 are more similar than categories 0 and 1). To fix this\\nissue, a common solution is to create one binary attribute per category: one attribute\\nequal to 1 when the category is “<1H OCEAN” (and 0 otherwise), another attribute\\nequal to 1 when the category is “INLAND” (and 0 otherwise), and so on. This is\\ncalled one-hot encoding, because only one attribute will be equal to 1 (hot), while the\\nothers will be 0 (cold).\\nScikit-Learn provides a OneHotEncoder encoder to convert integer categorical values\\ninto one-hot vectors. Let’s encode the categories as one-hot vectors. Note that\\nfit_transform() expects a 2D array, but housing_cat_encoded is a 1D array, so we\\nneed to reshape it:18\\n>>> from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder\\n>>> encoder = OneHotEncoder()\\n>>> housing_cat_1hot = encoder.fit_transform(housing_cat_encoded.reshape(-1,1))\\n>>> housing_cat_1hot\\n<16513x5 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>'\\n \\nwith 16513 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>\\nNotice that the output is a SciPy sparse matrix, instead of a NumPy array. This is very\\nuseful when you have categorical attributes with thousands of categories. After one-\\nhot encoding we get a matrix with thousands of columns, and the matrix is full of\\nzeros except for one 1 per row. Using up tons of memory mostly to store zeros would\\nbe very wasteful, so instead a sparse matrix only stores the location of the nonzero\\nelements. You can use it mostly like a normal 2D array,19 but if you really want to con‐\\nvert it to a (dense) NumPy array, just call the toarray() method:\\n>>> housing_cat_1hot.toarray()\\narray([[ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],\\n       [ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],\\n       [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  1.],\\n       ...,\\n       [ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.],\\nPrepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms \\n| \\n63\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com\"),\n",

You will want your transformer to work seamlessly with Scikit-Learn func‐\\ntionalities (such as pipelines), and since Scikit-Learn relies on duck typing (not inher‐\\nitance), all you need is to create a class and implement three methods: fit()\\n(returning self), transform(), and fit_transform(). You can get the last one for\\nfree by simply adding TransformerMixin as a base class. Also, if you add BaseEstima\\ntor as a base class (and avoid *args and **kargs in your constructor) you will get\\ntwo extra methods (get_params() and set_params()) that will be useful for auto‐\\nmatic hyperparameter tuning. For example, here is a small transformer class that adds\\nthe combined attributes we discussed earlier:\\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\\nrooms_ix, bedrooms_ix, population_ix, household_ix = 3, 4, 5, 6\\nclass CombinedAttributesAdder(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):\\n    def __init__(self, add_bedrooms_per_room = True): # no *args or **kargs\\n        self.add_bedrooms_per_room = add_bedrooms_per_room\\n    def fit(self, X, y=None):\\n        return self  # nothing else to do\\n    def transform(self, X, y=None):\\n        rooms_per_household = X[:, rooms_ix] / X[:, household_ix]\\n        population_per_household = X[:, population_ix] / X[:, household_ix]\\n        if self.add_bedrooms_per_room:\\n            bedrooms_per_room = X[:, bedrooms_ix] / X[:, rooms_ix]\\n64 \\n| \\nChapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

This hyperpara‐\\nmeter will allow you to easily find out whether adding this attribute helps the\\nMachine Learning algorithms or not. More generally, you can add a hyperparameter\\nto gate any data preparation step that you are not 100% sure about. The more you\\nautomate these data preparation steps, the more combinations you can automatically\\ntry out, making it much more likely that you will find a great combination (and sav‐\\ning you a lot of time).\\nFeature Scaling\\nOne of the most important transformations you need to apply to your data is feature\\nscaling. With few exceptions, Machine Learning algorithms don’t perform well when\\nthe input numerical attributes have very different scales. This is the case for the hous‐\\ning data: the total number of rooms ranges from about 6 to 39,320, while the median\\nincomes only range from 0 to 15. Note that scaling the target values is generally not\\nrequired.\\nThere are two common ways to get all attributes to have the same scale: min-max\\nscaling and standardization.\\nMin-max scaling (many people call this normalization) is quite simple: values are\\nshifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging from 0 to 1. We do this by subtract‐\\ning the min value and dividing by the max minus the min. Scikit-Learn provides a\\ntransformer called MinMaxScaler for this. It has a feature_range hyperparameter\\nthat lets you change the range if you don’t want 0–1 for some reason.\\nStandardization is quite different: first it subtracts the mean value (so standardized\\nvalues always have a zero mean), and then it divides by the variance so that the result‐\\ning distribution has unit variance. Unlike min-max scaling, standardization does not\\nbound values to a specific range, which may be a problem for some algorithms (e.g.,\\nneural networks often expect an input value ranging from 0 to 1). However, standard‐\\nization is much less affected by outliers. For example, suppose a district had a median\\nincome equal to 100 (by mistake). Min-max scaling would then crush all the other\\nvalues from 0–15 down to 0–0.15, whereas standardization would not be much affec‐\\nted. Scikit-Learn provides a transformer called StandardScaler for standardization.\\nPrepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms \\n| \\n65\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Fortunately, Scikit-Learn provides the Pipeline class to help with\\nsuch sequences of transformations. Here is a small pipeline for the numerical\\nattributes:\\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\\nnum_pipeline = Pipeline([\\n        (\\'imputer\\', Imputer(strategy=\"median\")),\\n        (\\'attribs_adder\\', CombinedAttributesAdder()),\\n        (\\'std_scaler\\', StandardScaler()),\\n    ])\\nhousing_num_tr = num_pipeline.fit_transform(housing_num)\\nThe Pipeline constructor takes a list of name/estimator pairs defining a sequence of\\nsteps. All but the last estimator must be transformers (i.e., they must have a\\nfit_transform() method). The names can be anything you like.\\nWhen you call the pipeline’s fit() method, it calls fit_transform() sequentially on\\nall transformers, passing the output of each call as the parameter to the next call, until\\nit reaches the final estimator, for which it just calls the fit() method.\\nThe pipeline exposes the same methods as the final estimator. In this example, the last\\nestimator is a StandardScaler, which is a transformer, so the pipeline has a trans\\nform() method that applies all the transforms to the data in sequence (it also has a\\nfit_transform method that we could have used instead of calling fit() and then\\ntransform()).\\nYou now have a pipeline for numerical values, and you also need to apply the LabelBi\\nnarizer on the categorical values: how can you join these transformations into a sin‐\\ngle pipeline? Scikit-Learn provides a FeatureUnion class for this. You give it a list of\\ntransformers (which can be entire transformer pipelines), and when its transform()\\nmethod is called it runs each transformer’s transform() method in parallel, waits for\\ntheir output, and then concatenates them and returns the result (and of course calling\\nits fit() method calls all each transformer’s fit() method).

Congratulations, you have suc‐\\ncessfully fine-tuned your best model!\\nDon’t forget that you can treat some of the data preparation steps as\\nhyperparameters. For example, the grid search will automatically\\nfind out whether or not to add a feature you were not sure about\\n(e.g., using the add_bedrooms_per_room hyperparameter of your\\nCombinedAttributesAdder transformer). It may similarly be used\\nto automatically find the best way to handle outliers, missing fea‐\\ntures, feature selection, and more.\\nRandomized Search\\nThe grid search approach is fine when you are exploring relatively few combinations,\\nlike in the previous example, but when the hyperparameter search space is large, it is\\noften preferable to use RandomizedSearchCV instead. This class can be used in much\\nthe same way as the GridSearchCV class, but instead of trying out all possible combi‐\\nnations, it evaluates a given number of random combinations by selecting a random\\nvalue for each hyperparameter at every iteration. This approach has two main bene‐\\nfits:\\n• If you let the randomized search run for, say, 1,000 iterations, this approach will\\nexplore 1,000 different values for each hyperparameter (instead of just a few val‐\\nues per hyperparameter with the grid search approach).\\n• You have more control over the computing budget you want to allocate to hyper‐\\nparameter search, simply by setting the number of iterations.\\nEnsemble Methods\\nAnother way to fine-tune your system is to try to combine the models that perform\\nbest. The group (or “ensemble”) will often perform better than the best individual\\nmodel (just like Random Forests perform better than the individual Decision Trees\\nthey rely on), especially if the individual models make very different types of errors.\\nWe will cover this topic in more detail in Chapter 7.\\nAnalyze the Best Models and Their Errors\\nYou will often gain good insights on the problem by inspecting the best models.

Either way, you need to plug the human evalua‐\\ntion pipeline into your system.\\nYou should also make sure you evaluate the system’s input data quality. Sometimes\\nperformance will degrade slightly because of a poor quality signal (e.g., a malfunc‐\\ntioning sensor sending random values, or another team’s output becoming stale), but\\nit may take a while before your system’s performance degrades enough to trigger an\\nalert. If you monitor your system’s inputs, you may catch this earlier.

In these cases, you can implement\\ncross-validation yourself; it is actually fairly straightforward.

This is simply because only about 10% of the\\nimages are 5s, so if you always guess that an image is not a 5, you will be right about\\n90% of the time. Beats Nostradamus.\\nThis demonstrates why accuracy is generally not the preferred performance measure\\nfor classifiers, especially when you are dealing with skewed datasets (i.e., when some\\nclasses are much more frequent than others).\\nConfusion Matrix\\nA much better way to evaluate the performance of a classifier is to look at the confu‐\\nsion matrix. The general idea is to count the number of times instances of class A are\\nclassified as class B. For example, to know the number of times the classifier confused\\nimages of 5s with 3s, you would look in the 5th row and 3rd column of the confusion\\nmatrix.\\nTo compute the confusion matrix, you first need to have a set of predictions, so they\\ncan be compared to the actual targets.

This is not always\\nwhat you want: in some contexts you mostly care about precision, and in other con‐\\ntexts you really care about recall. For example, if you trained a classifier to detect vid‐\\neos that are safe for kids, you would probably prefer a classifier that rejects many\\ngood videos (low recall) but keeps only safe ones (high precision), rather than a clas‐\\nsifier that has a much higher recall but lets a few really bad videos show up in your\\nproduct (in such cases, you may even want to add a human pipeline to check the clas‐\\nsifier’s video selection). On the other hand, suppose you train a classifier to detect\\nshoplifters on surveillance images: it is probably fine if your classifier has only 30%\\nprecision as long as it has 99% recall (sure, the security guards will get a few false\\nalerts, but almost all shoplifters will get caught).\\nUnfortunately, you can’t have it both ways: increasing precision reduces recall, and\\nvice versa. This is called the precision/recall tradeoff.\\nPrecision/Recall Tradeoff\\nTo understand this tradeoff, let’s look at how the SGDClassifier makes its classifica‐\\ntion decisions. For each instance, it computes a score based on a decision function, \\nand if that score is greater than a threshold, it assigns the instance to the positive\\nclass, or else it assigns it to the negative class. Figure 3-3 shows a few digits positioned\\nfrom the lowest score on the left to the highest score on the right. Suppose the deci‐\\nsion threshold is positioned at the central arrow (between the two 5s): you will find 4\\ntrue positives (actual 5s) on the right of that threshold, and one false positive (actually\\na 6). Therefore, with that threshold, the precision is 80% (4 out of 5). But out of 6\\nactual 5s, the classifier only detects 4, so the recall is 67% (4 out of 6). Now if you\\nraise the threshold (move it to the arrow on the right), the false positive (the 6)\\nbecomes a true negative, thereby increasing precision (up to 100% in this case), but\\none true positive becomes a false negative, decreasing recall down to 50%.

First, you need to get scores for each instance in the\\ntraining set. But due to the way it works (see Chapter 7), the RandomForestClassi\\nfier class does not have a decision_function() method. Instead it has a pre\\ndict_proba() method. Scikit-Learn classifiers generally have one or the other. The\\npredict_proba() method returns an array containing a row per instance and a col‐\\numn per class, each containing the probability that the given instance belongs to the\\ngiven class (e.g., 70% chance that the image represents a 5):\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\\nforest_clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)\\ny_probas_forest = cross_val_predict(forest_clf, X_train, y_train_5, cv=3,\\n                                    method=\"predict_proba\")\\nBut to plot a ROC curve, you need scores, not probabilities.

Others (such as Support Vector Machine\\nclassifiers or Linear classifiers) are strictly binary classifiers. However, there are vari‐\\nous strategies that you can use to perform multiclass classification using multiple\\nbinary classifiers.\\nFor example, one way to create a system that can classify the digit images into 10\\nclasses (from 0 to 9) is to train 10 binary classifiers, one for each digit (a 0-detector, a\\n1-detector, a 2-detector, and so on). Then when you want to classify an image, you get\\nthe decision score from each classifier for that image and you select the class whose\\nclassifier outputs the highest score. This is called the one-versus-all (OvA) strategy \\n(also called one-versus-the-rest).\\nAnother strategy is to train a binary classifier for every pair of digits: one to distin‐\\nguish 0s and 1s, another to distinguish 0s and 2s, another for 1s and 2s, and so on.\\nThis is called the one-versus-one (OvO) strategy. If there are N classes, you need to\\ntrain N × (N – 1) / 2 classifiers. For the MNIST problem, this means training 45\\nbinary classifiers! When you want to classify an image, you have to run the image\\nthrough all 45 classifiers and see which class wins the most duels. The main advan‐\\ntage of OvO is that each classifier only needs to be trained on the part of the training\\nset for the two classes that it must distinguish.\\nSome algorithms (such as Support Vector Machine classifiers) scale poorly with the\\nsize of the training set, so for these algorithms OvO is preferred since it is faster to\\ntrain many classifiers on small training sets than training few classifiers on large\\ntraining sets. For most binary classification algorithms, however, OvA is preferred.\\nScikit-Learn detects when you try to use a binary classification algorithm for a multi‐\\nclass classification task, and it automatically runs OvA (except for SVM classifiers for\\nwhich it uses OvO). Let’s try this with the SGDClassifier:\\n>>> sgd_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)  # y_train, not y_train_5\\n>>> sgd_clf.predict([some_digit])\\narray([ 5.])\\nThat was easy!

The digit 5 is indeed not large (False) and odd (True).\\nThere are many ways to evaluate a multilabel classifier, and selecting the right metric\\nreally depends on your project.

It is simply a generaliza‐\\ntion of multilabel classification where each label can be multiclass (i.e., it can have\\nmore than two possible values).\\nTo illustrate this, let’s build a system that removes noise from images. It will take as\\ninput a noisy digit image, and it will (hopefully) output a clean digit image, repre‐\\nsented as an array of pixel intensities, just like the MNIST images. Notice that the\\nclassifier’s output is multilabel (one label per pixel) and each label can have multiple\\nvalues (pixel intensity ranges from 0 to 255). It is thus an example of a multioutput\\nclassification system.\\nThe line between classification and regression is sometimes blurry,\\nsuch as in this example. Arguably, predicting pixel intensity is more\\nakin to regression than to classification. Moreover, multioutput\\nsystems are not limited to classification tasks; you could even have\\na system that outputs multiple labels per instance, including both\\nclass labels and value labels.\\nLet’s start by creating the training and test sets by taking the MNIST images and\\nadding noise to their pixel intensities using NumPy’s randint() function. The target\\nimages will be the original images:\\nnoise = rnd.randint(0, 100, (len(X_train), 784))\\nnoise = rnd.randint(0, 100, (len(X_test), 784))\\nX_train_mod = X_train + noise\\nX_test_mod = X_test + noise\\ny_train_mod = X_train\\ny_test_mod = X_test\\nLet’s take a peek at an image from the test set (yes, we’re snooping on the test data, so\\nyou should be frowning right now):\\nMultioutput Classification \\n| \\n101\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Understanding what’s under the hood will also help\\nyou debug issues and perform error analysis more efficiently. Lastly, most of the top‐\\nics discussed in this chapter will be essential in understanding, building, and training\\nneural networks (discussed in Part II of this book).\\nIn this chapter, we will start by looking at the Linear Regression model, one of the\\nsimplest models there is. We will discuss two very different ways to train it:\\n• Using a direct “closed-form” equation that directly computes the model parame‐\\nters that best fit the model to the training set (i.e., the model parameters that\\nminimize the cost function over the training set).\\n• Using an iterative optimization approach, called Gradient Descent (GD), that\\ngradually tweaks the model parameters to minimize the cost function over the\\ntraining set, eventually converging to the same set of parameters as the first\\nmethod.

It is a search in the model’s parameter space: the more parameters a model has,\\nthe more dimensions this space has, and the harder the search is: searching for a nee‐\\ndle in a 300-dimensional haystack is much trickier than in three dimensions. Fortu‐\\nnately, since the cost function is convex in the case of Linear Regression, the needle is\\nsimply at the bottom of the bowl.\\nBatch Gradient Descent\\nTo implement Gradient Descent, you need to compute the gradient of the cost func‐\\ntion with regards to each model parameter θj. In other words, you need to calculate\\nhow much the cost function will change if you change θj just a little bit. This is called \\na partial derivative. It is like asking “what is the slope of the mountain under my feet\\nif I face east?” and then asking the same question facing north (and so on for all other\\ndimensions, if you can imagine a universe with more than three dimensions).

In the middle, the learning rate looks pretty good: in\\njust a few iterations, it has already converged to the solution. On the right, the learn‐\\ning rate is too high: the algorithm diverges, jumping all over the place and actually\\ngetting further and further away from the solution at every step.\\nTo find a good learning rate, you can use grid search (see Chapter 2). However, you\\nmay want to limit the number of iterations so that grid search can eliminate models\\nthat take too long to converge.\\nYou may wonder how to set the number of iterations. If it is too low, you will still be\\nfar away from the optimal solution when the algorithm stops, but if it is too high, you\\nwill waste time while the model parameters do not change anymore. A simple solu‐\\ntion is to set a very large number of iterations but to interrupt the algorithm when the\\ngradient vector becomes tiny—that is, when its norm becomes smaller than a tiny\\nnumber ϵ (called the tolerance)—because this happens when Gradient Descent has\\n(almost) reached the minimum.\\n116 \\n| \\nChapter 4: Training Models\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

In other words, if you divide\\nthe tolerance ϵ by 10 (to have a more precise solution), then the algorithm will have\\nto run about 10 times more iterations.\\nStochastic Gradient Descent\\nThe main problem with Batch Gradient Descent is the fact that it uses the whole\\ntraining set to compute the gradients at every step, which makes it very slow when\\nthe training set is large. At the opposite extreme, Stochastic Gradient Descent just\\npicks a random instance in the training set at every step and computes the gradients\\nbased only on that single instance. Obviously this makes the algorithm much faster\\nsince it has very little data to manipulate at every iteration. It also makes it possible to\\ntrain on huge training sets, since only one instance needs to be in memory at each\\niteration (SGD can be implemented as an out-of-core algorithm.7)\\nOn the other hand, due to its stochastic (i.e., random) nature, this algorithm is much\\nless regular than Batch Gradient Descent: instead of gently decreasing until it reaches\\nthe minimum, the cost function will bounce up and down, decreasing only on aver‐\\nage. Over time it will end up very close to the minimum, but once it gets there it will\\ncontinue to bounce around, never settling down (see Figure 4-9). So once the algo‐\\nrithm stops, the final parameter values are good, but not optimal.\\nFigure 4-9.

One solution to this dilemma is\\nto gradually reduce the learning rate. The steps start out large (which helps make\\nquick progress and escape local minima), then get smaller and smaller, allowing the\\nalgorithm to settle at the global minimum.

First, let’s look at the performance on the training\\ndata: when there are just one or two instances in the training set, the model can fit\\nthem perfectly, which is why the curve starts at zero. But as new instances are added\\nto the training set, it becomes impossible for the model to fit the training data per‐\\nfectly, both because the data is noisy and because it is not linear at all. So the error on\\nthe training data goes up until it reaches a plateau, at which point adding new instan‐\\nces to the training set doesn’t make the average error much better or worse. Now let’s\\nlook at the performance of the model on the validation data. When the model is\\ntrained on very few training instances, it is incapable of generalizing properly, which\\nis why the validation error is initially quite big. Then as the model is shown more\\ntraining examples, it learns and thus the validation error slowly goes down. However,\\nonce again a straight line cannot do a good job modeling the data, so the error ends\\nup at a plateau, very close to the other curve.\\nThese learning curves are typical of an underfitting model. Both curves have reached\\na plateau; they are close and fairly high.\\nIf your model is underfitting the training data, adding more train‐\\ning examples will not help. You need to use a more complex model\\nor come up with better features.\\nNow let’s look at the learning curves of a 10th-degree polynomial model on the same\\ndata (Figure 4-16):\\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\\npolynomial_regression = Pipeline((\\n        (\"poly_features\", PolynomialFeatures(degree=10, include_bias=False)),\\n        (\"sgd_reg\", LinearRegression()),\\n    ))\\nplot_learning_curves(polynomial_regression, X, y)\\nThese learning curves look a bit like the previous ones, but there are two very impor‐\\ntant differences:\\n• The error on the training data is much lower than with the Linear Regression\\nmodel.\\n• There is a gap between the curves. This means that the model performs signifi‐\\ncantly better on the training data than on the validation data, which is the hall‐\\nmark of an overfitting model.

Logistic Regression (also called Logit Regression) is com‐\\nmonly used to estimate the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class\\n(e.g., what is the probability that this email is spam?). If the estimated probability is\\ngreater than 50%, then the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class\\n(called the positive class, labeled “1”), or else it predicts that it does not (i.e., it\\nbelongs to the negative class, labeled “0”). This makes it a binary classifier.\\nEstimating Probabilities\\nSo how does it work? Just like a Linear Regression model, a Logistic Regression\\nmodel computes a weighted sum of the input features (plus a bias term), but instead\\nof outputting the result directly like the Linear Regression model does, it outputs the\\nlogistic of this result (see Equation 4-13).\\nEquation 4-13. Logistic Regression model estimated probability (vectorized form)\\np = hθ �= σ θT · �\\nThe logistic—also called the logit, noted σ(·)—is a sigmoid function (i.e., S-shaped)\\nthat outputs a number between 0 and 1.

It is one of the most popular models in Machine Learning, and any‐\\none interested in Machine Learning should have it in their toolbox. SVMs are partic‐\\nularly well suited for classification of complex but small- or medium-sized datasets.\\nThis chapter will explain the core concepts of SVMs, how to use them, and how they\\nwork.\\nLinear SVM Classification\\nThe fundamental idea behind SVMs is best explained with some pictures. Figure 5-1\\nshows part of the iris dataset that was introduced at the end of Chapter 4. The two\\nclasses can clearly be separated easily with a straight line (they are linearly separable).\\nThe left plot shows the decision boundaries of three possible linear classifiers. The\\nmodel whose decision boundary is represented by the dashed line is so bad that it\\ndoes not even separate the classes properly. The other two models work perfectly on\\nthis training set, but their decision boundaries come so close to the instances that\\nthese models will probably not perform as well on new instances. In contrast, the\\nsolid line in the plot on the right represents the decision boundary of an SVM classi‐\\nfier; this line not only separates the two classes but also stays as far away from the\\nclosest training instances as possible. You can think of an SVM classifier as fitting the\\nwidest possible street (represented by the parallel dashed lines) between the classes.\\nThis is called large margin classification.\\n145\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

The downside is that a training set with m instances and n features\\ngets transformed into a training set with m instances and m features (assuming you\\ndrop the original features).

Increasing\\ngamma makes the bell-shape curve narrower (see the left plot of Figure 5-8), and as a\\nresult each instance’s range of influence is smaller: the decision boundary ends up\\nbeing more irregular, wiggling around individual instances. Conversely, a small gamma \\nvalue makes the bell-shaped curve wider, so instances have a larger range of influ‐\\nence, and the decision boundary ends up smoother. So γ acts like a regularization\\nhyperparameter: if your model is overfitting, you should reduce it, and if it is under‐\\nfitting, you should increase it (similar to the C hyperparameter).\\n152 \\n| \\nChapter 5: Support Vector Machines\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

An instance’s margin violation is equal to 0 if it is located off the street and on\\nthe correct side, or else it is proportional to the distance to the correct side of the\\nstreet. Minimizing this term ensures that the model makes the margin violations as\\nsmall and as few as possible\\nHinge Loss\\nThe function max(0, 1 – t) is called the hinge loss function (represented below). It is\\nequal to 0 when t ≥ 1. Its derivative (slope) is equal to –1 if t < 1 and 0 if t > 1. It is not\\ndifferentiable at t = 1, but just like for Lasso Regression (see “Lasso Regression” on\\npage 130) you can still use Gradient Descent using any subderivative at t = 0 (i.e., any\\nvalue between –1 and 0).\\n164 \\n| \\nChapter 5: Support Vector Machines\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Suppose you find\\nan iris flower and you want to classify it. You start at the root node (depth 0, at the\\ntop): this node asks whether the flower’s petal length is smaller than 2.45 cm. If it is,\\nthen you move down to the root’s left child node (depth 1, left). In this case, it is a leaf\\nnode (i.e., it does not have any children nodes), so it does not ask any questions: you\\ncan simply look at the predicted class for that node and the Decision Tree predicts\\nthat your flower is an Iris-Setosa (class=setosa).\\nNow suppose you find another flower, but this time the petal length is greater than\\n2.45 cm. You must move down to the root’s right child node (depth 1, right), which is\\nnot a leaf node, so it asks another question: is the petal width smaller than 1.75 cm? If\\nit is, then your flower is most likely an Iris-Versicolor (depth 2, left). If not, it is likely\\nan Iris-Virginica (depth 2, right). It’s really that simple.\\nOne of the many qualities of Decision Trees is that they require\\nvery little data preparation. In particular, they don’t require feature\\nscaling or centering at all.\\nA node’s samples attribute counts how many training instances it applies to. For\\nexample, 100 training instances have a petal length greater than 2.45 cm (depth 1,\\nright), among which 54 have a petal width smaller than 1.75 cm (depth 2, left). A\\nnode’s value attribute tells you how many training instances of each class this node\\napplies to: for example, the bottom-right node applies to 0 Iris-Setosa, 1 Iris-\\nVersicolor, and 45 Iris-Virginica. Finally, a node’s gini attribute measures its impur‐\\nity: a node is “pure” (gini=0) if all training instances it applies to belong to the same\\nclass. For example, since the depth-1 left node applies only to Iris-Setosa training\\ninstances, it is pure and its gini score is 0. Equation 6-1 shows how the training algo‐\\nrithm computes the gini score Gi of the ith node. For example, the depth-2 left node\\nhas a gini score equal to 1 – (0/54)2 – (49/54)2 – (5/54)2 ≈ 0.168. Another impurity\\nmeasure is discussed shortly.\\nEquation 6-1.

Such models are often called white box models. In contrast, as we will see, Ran‐\\ndom Forests or neural networks are generally considered black box models. They\\nmake great predictions, and you can easily check the calculations that they performed\\nto make these predictions; nevertheless, it is usually hard to explain in simple terms\\nwhy the predictions were made. For example, if a neural network says that a particu‐\\nlar person appears on a picture, it is hard to know what actually contributed to this\\nprediction: did the model recognize that person’s eyes? Her mouth? Her nose? Her\\nshoes? Or even the couch that she was sitting on? Conversely, Decision Trees provide\\nnice and simple classification rules that can even be applied manually if need be (e.g.,\\nfor flower classification).\\n170 \\n| \\nChapter 6: Decision Trees\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

For example, suppose\\nyou have found a flower whose petals are 5 cm long and 1.5 cm wide. The corre‐\\nsponding leaf node is the depth-2 left node, so the Decision Tree should output the\\nfollowing probabilities: 0% for Iris-Setosa (0/54), 90.7% for Iris-Versicolor (49/54),\\nand 9.3% for Iris-Virginica (5/54).

The idea is really quite simple: the algo‐\\nrithm first splits the training set in two subsets using a single feature k and a thres‐\\nhold tk (e.g., “petal length ≤ 2.45 cm”). How does it choose k and tk? It searches for the\\npair (k, tk) that produces the purest subsets (weighted by their size).

If left\\nunconstrained, the tree structure will adapt itself to the training data, fitting it very\\nclosely, and most likely overfitting it. Such a model is often called a nonparametric\\nmodel, not because it does not have any parameters (it often has a lot) but because the\\nnumber of parameters is not determined prior to training, so the model structure is\\nfree to stick closely to the data.

First, as you may have noticed, Decision\\nTrees love orthogonal decision boundaries (all splits are perpendicular to an axis),\\nwhich makes them sensitive to training set rotation. For example, Figure 6-7 shows a\\nsimple linearly separable dataset: on the left, a Decision Tree can split it easily, while\\non the right, after the dataset is rotated by 45°, the decision boundary looks unneces‐\\nsarily convoluted. Although both Decision Trees fit the training set perfectly, it is very\\nlikely that the model on the right will not generalize well. One way to limit this prob‐\\nlem is to use PCA (see Chapter 8), which often results in a better orientation of the\\ntraining data.\\nFigure 6-7.

It is possible to make\\ntrees even more random by also using random thresholds for each feature rather than\\nsearching for the best possible thresholds (like regular Decision Trees do).\\nA forest of such extremely random trees is simply called an Extremely Randomized\\nTrees ensemble12 (or Extra-Trees for short).

Its API is identical to the RandomForestClassifier class. Similarly, the Extra\\nTreesRegressor class has the same API as the RandomForestRegressor class.\\nIt is hard to tell in advance whether a RandomForestClassifier\\nwill perform better or worse than an ExtraTreesClassifier.

Zhu et al. (2006).\\n17 First introduced in “Arcing the Edge,” L. Breiman (1997).\\nScikit-Learn actually uses a multiclass version of AdaBoost called SAMME16 (which\\nstands for Stagewise Additive Modeling using a Multiclass Exponential loss function).\\nWhen there are just two classes, SAMME is equivalent to AdaBoost. Moreover, if the\\npredictors can estimate class probabilities (i.e., if they have a predict_proba()\\nmethod), Scikit-Learn can use a variant of SAMME called SAMME.R (the R stands\\nfor “Real”), which relies on class probabilities rather than predictions and generally\\nperforms better.\\nThe following code trains an AdaBoost classifier based on 200 Decision Stumps using\\nScikit-Learn’s AdaBoostClassifier class (as you might expect, there is also an Ada\\nBoostRegressor class). A Decision Stump is a Decision Tree with max_depth=1—in\\nother words, a tree composed of a single decision node plus two leaf nodes. This is\\nthe default base estimator for the AdaBoostClassifier class:\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier\\nada_clf = AdaBoostClassifier(\\n        DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1), n_estimators=200,\\n        algorithm=\"SAMME.R\", learning_rate=0.5\\n    )\\nada_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\\nIf your AdaBoost ensemble is overfitting the training set, you can\\ntry reducing the number of estimators or more strongly regulariz‐\\ning the base estimator.\\nGradient Boosting\\nAnother very popular Boosting algorithm is Gradient Boosting.17 Just like AdaBoost,\\nGradient Boosting works by sequentially adding predictors to an ensemble, each one\\ncorrecting its predecessor. However, instead of tweaking the instance weights at every\\niteration like AdaBoost does, this method tries to fit the new predictor to the residual\\nerrors made by the previous predictor.\\nLet’s go through a simple regression example using Decision Trees as the base predic‐\\ntors (of course Gradient Boosting also works great with regression tasks). This is\\ncalled Gradient Tree Boosting, or Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT). First, let’s\\nfit a DecisionTreeRegressor to the training set (for example, a noisy quadratic train‐\\ning set):\\nBoosting \\n| \\n195\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Put simply, a 2D manifold is a 2D\\nshape that can be bent and twisted in a higher-dimensional space. More generally, a\\nd-dimensional manifold is a part of an n-dimensional space (where d < n) that locally\\nresembles a d-dimensional hyperplane. In the case of the Swiss roll, d = 2 and n = 3: it\\nlocally resembles a 2D plane, but it is rolled in the third dimension.\\nMany dimensionality reduction algorithms work by modeling the manifold on which\\nthe training instances lie; this is called Manifold Learning. It relies on the manifold\\nassumption, also called the manifold hypothesis, which holds that most real-world\\nhigh-dimensional datasets lie close to a much lower-dimensional manifold. This\\nassumption is very often empirically observed.\\nOnce again, think about the MNIST dataset: all handwritten digit images have some\\nsimilarities. They are made of connected lines, the borders are white, they are more\\nor less centered, and so on. If you randomly generated images, only a ridiculously\\ntiny fraction of them would look like handwritten digits. In other words, the degrees\\nof freedom available to you if you try to create a digit image are dramatically lower\\nthan the degrees of freedom you would have if you were allowed to generate any\\nimage you wanted. These constraints tend to squeeze the dataset into a lower-\\ndimensional manifold.\\nThe manifold assumption is often accompanied by another implicit assumption: that\\nthe task at hand (e.g., classification or regression) will be simpler if expressed in the\\nlower-dimensional space of the manifold. For example, in the top row of Figure 8-6\\nthe Swiss roll is split into two classes: in the 3D space (on the left), the decision\\nboundary would be fairly complex, but in the 2D unrolled manifold space (on the\\nright), the decision boundary is a simple straight line.\\nHowever, this assumption does not always hold. For example, in the bottom row of\\nFigure 8-6, the decision boundary is located at x1 = 5. This decision boundary looks\\nvery simple in the original 3D space (a vertical plane), but it looks more complex in\\nthe unrolled manifold (a collection of four independent line segments).\\nIn short, if you reduce the dimensionality of your training set before training a\\nmodel, it will definitely speed up training, but it may not always lead to a better or\\nsimpler solution; it all depends on the dataset.\\nHopefully you now have a good sense of what the curse of dimensionality is and how\\ndimensionality reduction algorithms can fight it, especially when the manifold\\nassumption holds.

The most important thing to understand is that this code does\\nnot actually perform any computation, even though it looks like it does (especially the\\nlast line). It just creates a computation graph. In fact, even the variables are not ini‐\\ntialized yet. To evaluate this graph, you need to open a TensorFlow session and use it\\nto initialize the variables and evaluate f. A TensorFlow session takes care of placing\\nthe operations onto devices such as CPUs and GPUs and running them, and it holds\\nall the variable values.3 The following code creates a session, initializes the variables,\\nand evaluates, and f then closes the session (which frees up resources):\\n>>> sess = tf.Session()\\n>>> sess.run(x.initializer)\\n>>> sess.run(y.initializer)\\n>>> result = sess.run(f)\\n>>> print(result)\\n42\\n>>> sess.close()\\nHaving to repeat sess.run() all the time is a bit cumbersome, but fortunately there is\\na better way:\\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\\n    x.initializer.run()\\n    y.initializer.run()\\n    result = f.eval()\\nInside the with block, the session is set as the default session.

This makes the code easier to read. Moreover,\\nthe session is automatically closed at the end of the block.\\nInstead of manually running the initializer for every single variable, you can use the\\nglobal_variables_initializer() function. Note that it does not actually perform\\nthe initialization immediately, but rather creates a node in the graph that will initialize\\nall variables when it is run:\\ninit = tf.global_variables_initializer()  # prepare an init node\\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\\n    init.run()  # actually initialize all the variables\\n    result = f.eval()\\nInside Jupyter or within a Python shell you may prefer to create an InteractiveSes\\nsion.

The construction phase typically builds a computation graph\\nrepresenting the ML model and the computations required to train it.

In the case of Linear Regression, it is reasonably easy,\\nbut if you had to do this with deep neural networks you would get quite a headache:\\nit would be tedious and error-prone. You could use symbolic differentiation to auto‐\\nmatically find the equations for the partial derivatives for you, but the resulting code\\nwould not necessarily be very efficient.\\nTo understand why, consider the function f(x)= exp(exp(exp(x))). If you know calcu‐\\nlus, you can figure out its derivative f′(x) = exp(x) × exp(exp(x)) × exp(exp(exp(x))).\\nIf you code f(x) and f′(x) separately and exactly as they appear, your code will not be\\nas efficient as it could be. A more efficient solution would be to write a function that\\nfirst computes exp(x), then exp(exp(x)), then exp(exp(exp(x))), and returns all three.\\nThis gives you f(x) directly (the third term), and if you need the derivative you can\\njust multiply all three terms and you are done. With the naïve approach you would\\nhave had to call the exp function nine times to compute both f(x) and f′(x). With this\\napproach you just need to call it three times.\\nIt gets worse when your function is defined by some arbitrary code. Can you find the\\nequation (or the code) to compute the partial derivatives of the following function?\\nHint: don’t even try.\\ndef my_func(a, b):\\n    z = 0\\n    for i in range(100):\\n        z = a * np.cos(z + i) + z * np.sin(b - i)\\n    return z\\nFortunately, TensorFlow’s autodiff feature comes to the rescue: it can automatically\\nand efficiently compute the gradients for you. Simply replace the gradients = ...\\nline in the Gradient Descent code in the previous section with the following line, and\\nthe code will continue to work just fine:\\ngradients = tf.gradients(mse, [theta])[0]\\nThe gradients() function takes an op (in this case mse) and a list of variables (in this\\ncase just theta), and it creates a list of ops (one per variable) to compute the gradi‐\\nents of the op with regards to each variable. So the gradients node will compute the\\ngradient vector of the MSE with regards to theta.\\n238 \\n| \\nChapter 9: Up and Running with TensorFlow\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

You need to use a different log directory every time you\\nrun your program, or else TensorBoard will merge stats from different runs, which\\nwill mess up the visualizations.

The second\\n(optional) parameter is the graph you want to visualize.

The\\nidea is to use the get_variable() function to create the shared variable if it does not\\nexist yet, or reuse it if it already exists. The desired behavior (creating or reusing) is\\ncontrolled by an attribute of the current variable_scope(). For example, the follow‐\\ning code will create a variable named \"relu/threshold\" (as a scalar, since shape=(),\\nand using 0.0 as the initial value):\\nwith tf.variable_scope(\"relu\"):\\n    threshold = tf.get_variable(\"threshold\", shape=(),\\n                                initializer=tf.constant_initializer(0.0))\\nNote that if the variable has already been created by an earlier call to get_vari\\nable(), this code will raise an exception. This behavior prevents reusing variables by\\nmistake. If you want to reuse a variable, you need to explicitly say so by setting the\\nvariable scope’s reuse attribute to True (in which case you don’t have to specify the\\nshape or the initializer):\\nwith tf.variable_scope(\"relu\", reuse=True):\\n    threshold = tf.get_variable(\"threshold\")\\nThis code will fetch the existing \"relu/threshold\" variable, or raise an exception if it\\ndoes not exist or if it was not created using get_variable(). Alternatively, you can\\nset the reuse attribute to True inside the block by calling the scope’s reuse_vari\\nables() method:\\nwith tf.variable_scope(\"relu\") as scope:\\n    scope.reuse_variables()\\n    threshold = tf.get_variable(\"threshold\")\\nOnce reuse is set to True, it cannot be set back to False within the\\nblock.

In their landmark paper,2 “A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in\\nNervous Activity,” McCulloch and Pitts presented a simplified computational model\\nof how biological neurons might work together in animal brains to perform complex\\ncomputations using propositional logic. This was the first artificial neural network\\narchitecture. Since then many other architectures have been invented, as we will see.\\nThe early successes of ANNs until the 1960s led to the widespread belief that we\\nwould soon be conversing with truly intelligent machines. When it became clear that\\nthis promise would go unfulfilled (at least for quite a while), funding flew elsewhere\\nand ANNs entered a long dark era. In the early 1980s there was a revival of interest in\\nANNs as new network architectures were invented and better training techniques\\nwere developed. But by the 1990s, powerful alternative Machine Learning techniques\\nsuch as Support Vector Machines (see Chapter 5) were favored by most researchers,\\nas they seemed to offer better results and stronger theoretical foundations. Finally, we\\nare now witnessing yet another wave of interest in ANNs. Will this wave die out like\\nthe previous ones did? There are a few good reasons to believe that this one is differ‐\\nent and will have a much more profound impact on our lives:\\n• There is now a huge quantity of data available to train neural networks, and\\nANNs frequently outperform other ML techniques on very large and complex\\nproblems.\\n• The tremendous increase in computing power since the 1990s now makes it pos‐\\nsible to train large neural networks in a reasonable amount of time. This is in\\npart due to Moore’s Law, but also thanks to the gaming industry, which has pro‐\\nduced powerful GPU cards by the millions.\\n• The training algorithms have been improved. To be fair they are only slightly dif‐\\nferent from the ones used in the 1990s, but these relatively small tweaks have a\\nhuge positive impact.\\n• Some theoretical limitations of ANNs have turned out to be benign in practice.\\nFor example, many people thought that ANN training algorithms were doomed\\nbecause they were likely to get stuck in local optima, but it turns out that this is\\nrather rare in practice (or when it is the case, they are usually fairly close to the\\nglobal optimum).\\n• ANNs seem to have entered a virtuous circle of funding and progress.

It is an unusual-looking cell mostly found in animal cerebral\\ncortexes (e.g., your brain), composed of a cell body containing the nucleus and most\\nof the cell’s complex components, and many branching extensions called dendrites,\\nplus one very long extension called the axon. The axon’s length may be just a few\\ntimes longer than the cell body, or up to tens of thousands of times longer. Near its\\nextremity the axon splits off into many branches called telodendria, and at the tip of\\nthese branches are minuscule structures called synaptic terminals (or simply synap‐\\nses), which are connected to the dendrites (or directly to the cell body) of other neu‐\\nrons. Biological neurons receive short electrical impulses called signals from other\\nneurons via these synapses. When a neuron receives a sufficient number of signals\\nfrom other neurons within a few milliseconds, it fires its own signals.\\nFigure 10-1. Biological neuron3\\nThus, individual biological neurons seem to behave in a rather simple way, but they\\nare organized in a vast network of billions of neurons, each neuron typically connec‐\\nted to thousands of other neurons.

The last\\nstep of the backpropagation algorithm is a Gradient Descent step on all the connec‐\\ntion weights in the network, using the error gradients measured earlier.\\nLet’s make this even shorter: for each training instance the backpropagation algo‐\\nrithm first makes a prediction (forward pass), measures the error, then goes through\\neach layer in reverse to measure the error contribution from each connection (reverse\\npass), and finally slightly tweaks the connection weights to reduce the error (Gradient\\nDescent step).\\nIn order for this algorithm to work properly, the authors made a key change to the\\nMLP’s architecture: they replaced the step function with the logistic function, σ(z) =\\n1 / (1 + exp(–z)). This was essential because the step function contains only flat seg‐\\nments, so there is no gradient to work with (Gradient Descent cannot move on a flat\\nsurface), while the logistic function has a well-defined nonzero derivative every‐\\nwhere, allowing Gradient Descent to make some progress at every step. The backpro‐\\npagation algorithm may be used with other activation functions, instead of the logistic\\nfunction. Two other popular activation functions are:\\nThe hyperbolic tangent function tanh (z) = 2σ(2z) – 1\\nJust like the logistic function it is S-shaped, continuous, and differentiable, but its\\noutput value ranges from –1 to 1 (instead of 0 to 1 in the case of the logistic func‐\\ntion), which tends to make each layer’s output more or less normalized (i.e., cen‐\\ntered around 0) at the beginning of training.

It is continuous but unfortunately not differentiable at z =\\n0 (the slope changes abruptly, which can make Gradient Descent bounce\\naround). However, in practice it works very well and has the advantage of being\\nfast to compute.

In this section we\\nwill build the same model as before using this API, and we will implement Mini-\\nbatch Gradient Descent to train it on the MNIST dataset. The first step is the con‐\\nstruction phase, building the TensorFlow graph. The second step is the execution\\nphase, where you actually run the graph to train the model.\\nConstruction Phase\\nLet’s start. First we need to import the tensorflow library. Then we must specify the\\nnumber of inputs and outputs, and set the number of hidden neurons in each layer:\\nimport tensorflow as tf\\nn_inputs = 28*28  # MNIST\\nn_hidden1 = 300\\nn_hidden2 = 100\\nn_outputs = 10\\nNext, just like you did in Chapter 9, you can use placeholder nodes to represent the\\ntraining data and targets. The shape of X is only partially defined. We know that it will\\nbe a 2D tensor (i.e., a matrix), with instances along the first dimension and features\\nalong the second dimension, and we know that the number of features is going to be\\n28 x 28 (one feature per pixel), but we don’t know yet how many instances each train‐\\ning batch will contain. So the shape of X is (None, n_inputs). Similarly, we know\\nthat y will be a 1D tensor with one entry per instance, but again we don’t know the\\nsize of the training batch at this point, so the shape is (None).\\nX = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, n_inputs), name=\"X\")\\ny = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, shape=(None), name=\"y\")\\nNow let’s create the actual neural network. The placeholder X will act as the input\\nlayer; during the execution phase, it will be replaced with one training batch at a time\\n(note that all the instances in a training batch will be processed simultaneously by the\\nneural network). Now you need to create the two hidden layers and the output layer.\\nThe two hidden layers are almost identical: they differ only by the inputs they are\\nconnected to and by the number of neurons they contain. The output layer is also\\nvery similar, but it uses a softmax activation function instead of a ReLU activation\\nfunction. So let’s create a neuron_layer() function that we will use to create one layer\\nat a time. It will need parameters to specify the inputs, the number of neurons, the\\nactivation function, and the name of the layer:\\ndef neuron_layer(X, n_neurons, name, activation=None):\\n    with tf.name_scope(name):\\n        n_inputs = int(X.get_shape()[1])\\nTraining a DNN Using Plain TensorFlow \\n| \\n265\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Using this specific standard deviation helps the algorithm\\nconverge much faster (we will discuss this further in Chapter 11; it is one of those\\nsmall tweaks to neural networks that have had a tremendous impact on their effi‐\\nciency).

Real-\\nworld data is often structured in such a hierarchical way and DNNs automatically\\ntake advantage of this fact: lower hidden layers model low-level structures (e.g., line\\nsegments of various shapes and orientations), intermediate hidden layers combine\\nthese low-level structures to model intermediate-level structures (e.g., squares, cir‐\\ncles), and the highest hidden layers and the output layer combine these intermediate\\nstructures to model high-level structures (e.g., faces).\\nNot only does this hierarchical architecture help DNNs converge faster to a good sol‐\\nution, it also improves their ability to generalize to new datasets. For example, if you\\nhave already trained a model to recognize faces in pictures, and you now want to\\ntrain a new neural network to recognize hairstyles, then you can kickstart training by\\nreusing the lower layers of the first network.

For more complex problems, you can gradually ramp\\nup the number of hidden layers, until you start overfitting the training set.

For example, the MNIST task requires 28\\nx 28 = 784 input neurons and 10 output neurons. As for the hidden layers, a common\\npractice is to size them to form a funnel, with fewer and fewer neurons at each layer—\\nthe rationale being that many low-level features can coalesce into far fewer high-level\\nfeatures. For example, a typical neural network for MNIST may have two hidden lay‐\\ners, the first with 300 neurons and the second with 100. However, this practice is not\\nas common now, and you may simply use the same size for all hidden layers—for\\nexample, all hidden layers with 150 neurons: that’s just one hyperparameter to tune\\ninstead of one per layer. Just like for the number of layers, you can try increasing the\\nnumber of neurons gradually until the network starts overfitting. In general you will\\nget more bang for the buck by increasing the number of layers than the number of\\nneurons per layer. Unfortunately, as you can see, finding the perfect amount of neu‐\\nrons is still somewhat of a black art.\\nA simpler approach is to pick a model with more layers and neurons than you\\nactually need, then use early stopping to prevent it from overfitting (and other regu‐\\nlarization techniques, especially dropout, as we will see in Chapter 11). This has been\\ndubbed the “stretch pants” approach:12 instead of wasting time looking for pants that\\nperfectly match your size, just use large stretch pants that will shrink down to the\\nright size.\\nActivation Functions\\nIn most cases you can use the ReLU activation function in the hidden layers (or one\\nof its variants, as we will see in Chapter 11). It is a bit faster to compute than other\\nactivation functions, and Gradient Descent does not get stuck as much on plateaus,\\nthanks to the fact that it does not saturate for large input values (as opposed to the\\nlogistic function or the hyperbolic tangent function, which saturate at 1).\\nFor the output layer, the softmax activation function is generally a good choice for\\nclassification tasks (when the classes are mutually exclusive). For regression tasks,\\nyou can simply use no activation function at all.\\nThis concludes this introduction to artificial neural networks. In the following chap‐\\nters, we will discuss techniques to train very deep nets, and distribute training across\\nmultiple servers and GPUs. Then we will explore a few other popular neural network\\narchitectures: convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and autoen‐\\ncoders.13\\n272 \\n| \\nChapter 10: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

As a result, the Gradient Descent update leaves the lower\\nlayer connection weights virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good\\nsolution. This is called the vanishing gradients problem. In some cases, the opposite\\ncan happen: the gradients can grow bigger and bigger, so many layers get insanely\\nlarge weight updates and the algorithm diverges. This is the exploding gradients prob‐\\nlem, which is mostly encountered in recurrent neural networks (see Chapter 14).\\nMore generally, deep neural networks suffer from unstable gradients; different layers\\nmay learn at widely different speeds.\\nAlthough this unfortunate behavior has been empirically observed for quite a while\\n(it was one of the reasons why deep neural networks were mostly abandoned for a\\nlong time), it is only around 2010 that significant progress was made in understand‐\\ning it. A paper titled “Understanding the Difficulty of Training Deep Feedforward\\nNeural Networks” by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio1 found a few suspects, includ‐\\ning the combination of the popular logistic sigmoid activation function and the\\nweight initialization technique that was most popular at the time, namely random ini‐\\ntialization using a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\\nIn short, they showed that with this activation function and this initialization scheme,\\nthe variance of the outputs of each layer is much greater than the variance of its\\ninputs. Going forward in the network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer\\nuntil the activation function saturates at the top layers. This is actually made worse by\\nthe fact that the logistic function has a mean of 0.5, not 0 (the hyperbolic tangent\\nfunction has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly better than the logistic function in deep\\nnetworks).\\nLooking at the logistic activation function (see Figure 11-1), you can see that when\\ninputs become large (negative or positive), the function saturates at 0 or 1, with a\\nderivative extremely close to 0. Thus when backpropagation kicks in, it has virtually\\nno gradient to propagate back through the network, and what little gradient exists\\nkeeps getting diluted as backpropagation progresses down through the top layers, so\\nthere is really nothing left for the lower layers.\\n276 \\n| \\nChapter 11: Training Deep Neural Nets\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Until then most people had assumed that if Mother Nature had chosen to use\\nroughly sigmoid activation functions in biological neurons, they must be an excellent\\nchoice. But it turns out that other activation functions behave much better in deep\\nneural networks, in particular the ReLU activation function, mostly because it does\\nnot saturate for positive values (and also because it is quite fast to compute).\\nUnfortunately, the ReLU activation function is not perfect. It suffers from a problem\\nknown as the dying ReLUs: during training, some neurons effectively die, meaning\\nthey stop outputting anything other than 0. In some cases, you may find that half of\\nyour network’s neurons are dead, especially if you used a large learning rate. During\\ntraining, if a neuron’s weights get updated such that the weighted sum of the neuron’s\\ninputs is negative, it will start outputting 0. When this happen, the neuron is unlikely\\nto come back to life since the gradient of the ReLU function is 0 when its input is\\nnegative.\\nTo solve this problem, you may want to use a variant of the ReLU function, such as\\nthe leaky ReLU. This function is defined as LeakyReLUα(z) = max(αz, z) (see\\nFigure 11-2). The hyperparameter α defines how much the function “leaks”: it is the\\nslope of the function for z < 0, and is typically set to 0.01. This small slope ensures\\nthat leaky ReLUs never die; they can go into a long coma, but they have a chance to\\neventually wake up. A recent paper5 compared several variants of the ReLU activation\\nfunction and one of its conclusions was that the leaky variants always outperformed\\nthe strict ReLU activation function. In fact, setting α = 0.2 (huge leak) seemed to\\nresult in better performance than α = 0.01 (small leak). They also evaluated the\\nrandomized leaky ReLU (RReLU), where α is picked randomly in a given range during\\ntraining, and it is fixed to an average value during testing. It also performed fairly well\\nand seemed to act as a regularizer (reducing the risk of overfitting the training set).\\nFinally, they also evaluated the parametric leaky ReLU (PReLU), where α is authorized\\nto be learned during training (instead of being a hyperparameter, it becomes a\\nparameter that can be modified by backpropagation like any other parameter).

Szegedy (2015).\\nBatch Normalization\\nAlthough using He initialization along with ELU (or any variant of ReLU) can signifi‐\\ncantly reduce the vanishing/exploding gradients problems at the beginning of train‐\\ning, it doesn’t guarantee that they won’t come back during training.\\nIn a 2015 paper,7 Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy proposed a technique called\\nBatch Normalization (BN) to address the vanishing/exploding gradients problems,\\nand more generally the problem that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes\\nduring training, as the parameters of the previous layers change (which they call the\\nInternal Covariate Shift problem).\\nThe technique consists of adding an operation in the model just before the activation\\nfunction of each layer, simply zero-centering and normalizing the inputs, then scaling\\nand shifting the result using two new parameters per layer (one for scaling, the other\\nfor shifting). In other words, this operation lets the model learn the optimal scale and\\nmean of the inputs for each layer.\\nIn order to zero-center and normalize the inputs, the algorithm needs to estimate the\\ninputs’ mean and standard deviation. It does so by evaluating the mean and standard\\ndeviation of the inputs over the current mini-batch (hence the name “Batch Normal‐\\nization”). The whole operation is summarized in Equation 11-3.\\nEquation 11-3.

These are typically efficiently computed during training using a moving aver‐\\nage. So, in total, four parameters are learned for each batch-normalized layer: γ\\n(scale), β (offset), μ (mean), and σ (standard deviation).\\nThe authors demonstrated that this technique considerably improved all the deep\\nneural networks they experimented with. The vanishing gradients problem was\\nstrongly reduced, to the point that they could use saturating activation functions such\\nas the tanh and even the logistic activation function. The networks were also much\\nless sensitive to the weight initialization. They were able to use much larger learning\\nrates, significantly speeding up the learning process. Specifically, they note that\\n“Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization ach‐\\nieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original\\nmodel by a significant margin. […] Using an ensemble of batch-normalized net‐\\nworks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reach‐\\ning 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of\\nhuman raters.” Finally, like a gift that keeps on giving, Batch Normalization also acts\\nlike a regularizer, reducing the need for other regularization techniques (such as\\ndropout, described later in the chapter).\\nBatch Normalization does, however, add some complexity to the model (although it\\nremoves the need for normalizing the input data since the first hidden layer will take\\ncare of that, provided it is batch-normalized). Moreover, there is a runtime penalty:\\nthe neural network makes slower predictions due to the extra computations required\\nat each layer. So if you need predictions to be lightning-fast, you may want to check\\nhow well plain ELU + He initialization perform before playing with Batch Normaliza‐\\ntion.\\nYou may find that training is rather slow at first while Gradient\\nDescent is searching for the optimal scales and offsets for each\\nlayer, but it accelerates once it has found reasonably good values.\\nVanishing/Exploding Gradients Problems \\n| \\n283\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

If you\\ndon’t set this parameter, by default TensorFlow will just add the operations that\\nupdate the running averages to a collection of operations that you must run yourself.\\nLastly, we create the layers by calling the fully_connected() function, just like we\\ndid in Chapter 10, but this time we tell it to use the batch_norm() function (with the\\nparameters nb_params) to normalize the inputs right before calling the activation\\nfunction.\\nNote that by default batch_norm() only centers, normalizes, and shifts the inputs; it\\ndoes not scale them (i.e., γ is fixed to 1).

For example,\\nyou could first run the whole training set through the lower layers (assuming you\\nhave enough RAM):\\nhidden2_outputs = sess.run(hidden2, feed_dict={X: X_train})\\nThen during training, instead of building batches of training instances, you would\\nbuild batches of outputs from hidden layer 2 and feed them to the training operation:\\nimport numpy as np\\nn_epochs = 100\\nn_batches = 500\\nfor epoch in range(n_epochs):\\n    shuffled_idx = rnd.permutation(len(hidden2_outputs))\\n    hidden2_batches = np.array_split(hidden2_outputs[shuffled_idx], n_batches)\\n    y_batches = np.array_split(y_train[shuffled_idx], n_batches)\\n    for hidden2_batch, y_batch in zip(hidden2_batches, y_batches):\\n        sess.run(training_op, feed_dict={hidden2: hidden2_batch, y: y_batch})\\nThe last line runs the training operation defined earlier (which freezes layers 1 and 2),\\nand feeds it a batch of outputs from the second hidden layer (as well as the targets for\\nthat batch). Since we give TensorFlow the output of hidden layer 2, it does not try to\\nevaluate it (or any node it depends on).\\nTweaking, Dropping, or Replacing the Upper Layers\\nThe output layer of the original model should usually be replaced since it is most\\nlikely not useful at all for the new task, and it may not even have the right number of\\noutputs for the new task.\\nSimilarly, the upper hidden layers of the original model are less likely to be as useful\\nas the lower layers, since the high-level features that are most useful for the new task\\nmay differ significantly from the ones that were most useful for the original task.

If you have plenty of train‐\\ning data, you may try replacing the top hidden layers instead of dropping them, and\\neven add more hidden layers.\\nModel Zoos\\nWhere can you find a neural network trained for a task similar to the one you want to\\ntackle? The first place to look is obviously in your own catalog of models. This is one\\ngood reason to save all your models and organize them so you can retrieve them later\\neasily. Another option is to search in a model zoo. Many people train Machine Learn‐\\ning models for various tasks and kindly release their pretrained models to the public.\\nTensorFlow has its own model zoo available at https://github.com/tensorflow/models.\\nIn particular, it contains most of the state-of-the-art image classification nets such as\\nVGG, Inception, and ResNet (see Chapter 13, and check out the models/slim direc‐\\ntory), including the code, the pretrained models, and tools to download popular\\nimage datasets.\\nAnother popular model zoo is Caffe’s Model Zoo. It also contains many computer\\nvision models (e.g., LeNet, AlexNet, ZFNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, inception) trained\\non various datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Places Database, CIFAR10, etc.). Saumitro Das‐\\ngupta wrote a converter, which is available at https://github.com/ethereon/caffe-\\ntensorflow.\\nUnsupervised Pretraining\\nSuppose you want to tackle a complex task for which you don’t have much labeled\\ntraining data, but unfortunately you cannot find a model trained on a similar task.\\nDon’t lose all hope! First, you should of course try to gather more labeled training\\ndata, but if this is too hard or too expensive, you may still be able to perform unsuper‐\\nvised pretraining (see Figure 11-5). That is, if you have plenty of unlabeled training\\ndata, you can try to train the layers one by one, starting with the lowest layer and then\\ngoing up, using an unsupervised feature detector algorithm such as Restricted Boltz‐\\nmann Machines (RBMs; see Appendix E) or autoencoders (see Chapter 15). Each\\nlayer is trained on the output of the previously trained layers (all layers except the one\\nbeing trained are frozen). Once all layers have been trained this way, you can fine-\\ntune the network using supervised learning (i.e., with backpropagation).\\nThis is a rather long and tedious process, but it often works well; in fact, it is this\\ntechnique that Geoffrey Hinton and his team used in 2006 and which led to the\\nrevival of neural networks and the success of Deep Learning. Until 2010, unsuper‐\\nvised pretraining (typically using RBMs) was the norm for deep nets, and it was only\\nafter the vanishing gradients problem was alleviated that it became much more com‐\\nmon to train DNNs purely using backpropagation. However, unsupervised pretrain‐\\ning (today typically using autoencoders rather than RBMs) is still a good option when\\nReusing Pretrained Layers \\n| \\n291\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

In this situation, a common technique is to label all your training exam‐\\nples as “good,” then generate many new training instances by corrupting the good\\nones, and label these corrupted instances as “bad.” Then you can train a first neural\\nnetwork to classify instances as good or bad. For example, you could download mil‐\\nlions of sentences, label them as “good,” then randomly change a word in each sen‐\\ntence and label the resulting sentences as “bad.” If a neural network can tell that “The\\ndog sleeps” is a good sentence but “The dog they” is bad, it probably knows quite a lot\\nabout language. Reusing its lower layers will likely help in many language processing\\ntasks.\\nAnother approach is to train a first network to output a score for each training\\ninstance, and use a cost function that ensures that a good instance’s score is greater\\nthan a bad instance’s score by at least some margin. This is called max margin learn‐\\ning.\\nFaster Optimizers\\nTraining a very large deep neural network can be painfully slow. So far we have seen\\nfour ways to speed up training (and reach a better solution): applying a good initiali‐\\nzation strategy for the connection weights, using a good activation function, using\\nBatch Normalization, and reusing parts of a pretrained network. Another huge speed\\nboost comes from using a faster optimizer than the regular Gradient Descent opti‐\\nmizer. In this section we will present the most popular ones: Momentum optimiza‐\\ntion, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient, AdaGrad, RMSProp, and finally Adam\\noptimization.\\nSpoiler alert: the conclusion of this section is that you should almost always use \\nAdam optimization,10 so if you don’t care about how it works, simply replace your\\nGradientDescentOptimizer with an AdamOptimizer and skip to the next section!\\nWith just this small change, training will typically be several times faster. However,\\nAdam optimization does have three hyperparameters that you can tune (plus the\\nlearning rate); the default values usually work fine, but if you ever need to tweak them\\nit may be helpful to know what they do.

Polyak (1964).\\nMomentum optimization\\nImagine a bowling ball rolling down a gentle slope on a smooth surface: it will start\\nout slowly, but it will quickly pick up momentum until it eventually reaches terminal\\nvelocity (if there is some friction or air resistance). This is the very simple idea behind\\nMomentum optimization, proposed by Boris Polyak in 1964.11 In contrast, regular\\nGradient Descent will simply take small regular steps down the slope, so it will take\\nmuch more time to reach the bottom.\\nRecall that Gradient Descent simply updates the weights θ by directly subtracting the\\ngradient of the cost function J(θ) with regards to the weights (∇θJ(θ)) multiplied by\\nthe learning rate η. The equation is: θ ← θ – η∇θJ(θ). It does not care about what the\\nearlier gradients were. If the local gradient is tiny, it goes very slowly.\\nMomentum optimization cares a great deal about what previous gradients were: at\\neach iteration, it adds the local gradient to the momentum vector m (multiplied by the\\nlearning rate η), and it updates the weights by simply subtracting this momentum\\nvector (see Equation 11-4). In other words, the gradient is used as an acceleration, not\\nas a speed. To simulate some sort of friction mechanism and prevent the momentum\\nfrom growing too large, the algorithm introduces a new hyperparameter β, simply\\ncalled the momentum, which must be set between 0 (high friction) and 1 (no friction).\\nA typical momentum value is 0.9.\\nEquation 11-4. Momentum algorithm\\n1 .\\n�\\nβ�+ η∇θJ θ\\n2 .\\nθ\\nθ −�\\nYou can easily verify that if the gradient remains constant, the terminal velocity (i.e.,\\nthe maximum size of the weight updates) is equal to that gradient multiplied by the\\nlearning rate η multiplied by \\n1\\n1 −β. For example, if β = 0.9, then the terminal velocity\\nis equal to 10 times the gradient times the learning rate, so Momentum optimization\\nends up going 10 times faster than Gradient Descent! This allows Momentum opti‐\\nmization to escape from plateaus much faster than Gradient Descent. In particular,\\nwe saw in Chapter 4 that when the inputs have very different scales the cost function\\nwill look like an elongated bowl (see Figure 4-7). Gradient Descent goes down the\\nsteep slope quite fast, but then it takes a very long time to go down the valley.

Count the number of steps since the last “win‐\\nner” snapshot was saved, and interrupt training when this number reaches some limit\\n(e.g., 2,000 steps). Then restore the last “winner” snapshot.\\nAlthough early stopping works very well in practice, you can usually get much higher\\nperformance out of your network by combining it with other regularization techni‐\\nques.\\nℓ1 and ℓ2 Regularization\\nJust like you did in Chapter 4 for simple linear models, you can use ℓ1 and ℓ2 regulari‐\\nzation to constrain a neural network’s connection weights (but typically not its bia‐\\nses).\\nOne way to do this using TensorFlow is to simply add the appropriate regularization\\nterms to your cost function. For example, assuming you have just one hidden layer\\nwith weights weights1 and one output layer with weights weights2, then you can\\napply ℓ1 regularization like this:\\n[...] # construct the neural network\\nbase_loss = tf.reduce_mean(xentropy, name=\"avg_xentropy\")\\nreg_losses = tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(weights1)) + tf.reduce_sum(tf.abs(weights2))\\nloss = tf.add(base_loss, scale * reg_losses, name=\"loss\")\\nHowever, if there are many layers, this approach is not very convenient. Fortunately,\\nTensorFlow provides a better option. Many functions that create variables (such as\\nget_variable() or fully_connected()) accept a *_regularizer argument for each\\ncreated variable (e.g., weights_regularizer). You can pass any function that takes\\nweights as an argument and returns the corresponding regularization loss. The\\nl1_regularizer(), l2_regularizer(), and l1_l2_regularizer() functions return \\nsuch functions.

The hyperparameter p is\\ncalled the dropout rate, and it is typically set to 50%. After training, neurons don’t get\\ndropped anymore.

The following code creates a node clip_weights that will clip the\\nweights variable along the second axis so that each row vector has a maximum norm\\nof 1.0:\\nthreshold = 1.0\\nclipped_weights = tf.clip_by_norm(weights, clip_norm=threshold, axes=1)\\nclip_weights = tf.assign(weights, clipped_weights)\\nYou would then apply this operation after each training step, like so:\\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\\n    [...]\\n    for epoch in range(n_epochs):\\n        [...]\\n        for X_batch, y_batch in zip(X_batches, y_batches):\\n            sess.run(training_op, feed_dict={X: X_batch, y: y_batch})\\n            clip_weights.eval()\\nYou may wonder how to get access to the weights variable of each layer. For this you\\ncan simply use a variable scope like this:\\nhidden1 = fully_connected(X, n_hidden1, scope=\"hidden1\")\\nwith tf.variable_scope(\"hidden1\", reuse=True):\\n    weights1 = tf.get_variable(\"weights\")\\nAlternatively, you can use the root variable scope:\\nhidden1 = fully_connected(X, n_hidden1, scope=\"hidden1\")\\nhidden2 = fully_connected(hidden1, n_hidden2, scope=\"hidden2\")\\nAvoiding Overfitting Through Regularization \\n| \\n307\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

However, the TensorFlow team is working on\\nimproving the dynamic placer, and perhaps it will eventually be good enough to be\\nreleased.\\nUntil then TensorFlow relies on the simple placer, which (as its name suggests) is very\\nbasic.\\nSimple placement\\nWhenever you run a graph, if TensorFlow needs to evaluate a node that is not placed\\non a device yet, it uses the simple placer to place it, along with all other nodes that are\\nnot placed yet. The simple placer respects the following rules:\\n• If a node was already placed on a device in a previous run of the graph, it is left\\non that device.\\n• Else, if the user pinned a node to a device (described next), the placer places it on\\nthat device.\\n• Else, it defaults to GPU #0, or the CPU if there is no GPU.\\nAs you can see, placing operations on the appropriate device is mostly up to you. If\\nyou don’t do anything, the whole graph will be placed on the default device. To pin\\nnodes onto a device, you must create a device block using the device() function.

Machine B just hosts one TensorFlow server,\\npart of the \"worker\" job.\\ncluster_spec = tf.train.ClusterSpec({\\n    \"ps\": [\\n        \"machine-a.example.com:2221\",  # /job:ps/task:0\\n    ],\\n    \"worker\": [\\n        \"machine-a.example.com:2222\",  # /job:worker/task:0\\n        \"machine-b.example.com:2222\",  # /job:worker/task:1\\n    ]})\\nTo start a TensorFlow server, you must create a Server object, passing it the cluster\\nspecification (so it can communicate with other servers) and its own job name and\\ntask number. For example, to start the first worker task, you would run the following\\ncode on machine A:\\nserver = tf.train.Server(cluster_spec, job_name=\"worker\", task_index=0)\\nIt is usually simpler to just run one task per machine, but the previous example dem‐\\nonstrates that TensorFlow allows you to run multiple tasks on the same machine if\\n324 \\n| \\nChapter 12: Distributing TensorFlow Across Devices and Servers\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

For large models with millions of parameters, it is useful to shard\\nthese parameters across multiple parameter servers, to reduce the risk of saturating a\\nsingle parameter server’s network card. If you were to manually pin every variable to\\na different parameter server, it would be quite tedious. Fortunately, TensorFlow pro‐\\nvides the replica_device_setter() function, which distributes variables across all\\nthe \"ps\" tasks in a round-robin fashion. For example, the following code pins five\\nvariables to two parameter servers:\\nwith tf.device(tf.train.replica_device_setter(ps_tasks=2):\\n    v1 = tf.Variable(1.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:0\\n    v2 = tf.Variable(2.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:1\\n    v3 = tf.Variable(3.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:0\\n    v4 = tf.Variable(4.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:1\\n    v5 = tf.Variable(5.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:0\\nInstead of passing the number of ps_tasks, you can pass the cluster spec clus\\nter=cluster_spec and TensorFlow will simply count the number of tasks in the \"ps\"\\njob.\\nIf you create other operations in the block, beyond just variables, TensorFlow auto‐\\nmatically pins them to \"/job:worker\", which will default to the first device managed\\nby the first task in the \"worker\" job. You can pin them to another device by setting\\nthe worker_device parameter, but a better approach is to use embedded device\\nblocks. An inner device block can override the job, task, or device defined in an outer\\nblock. For example:\\nwith tf.device(tf.train.replica_device_setter(ps_tasks=2)):\\n    v1 = tf.Variable(1.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:0 (+ defaults to /cpu:0)\\n    v2 = tf.Variable(2.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:1 (+ defaults to /cpu:0)\\n    v3 = tf.Variable(3.0)  # pinned to /job:ps/task:0 (+ defaults to /cpu:0)\\n    [...]\\n    s = v1 + v2            # pinned to /job:worker (+ defaults to task:0/gpu:0)\\n    with tf.device(\"/gpu:1\"):\\n        p1 = 2 * s         # pinned to /job:worker/gpu:1 (+ defaults to /task:0)\\n        with tf.device(\"/task:1\"):\\n            p2 = 3 * s     # pinned to /job:worker/task:1/gpu:1\\nThis example assumes that the parameter servers are CPU-only,\\nwhich is typically the case since they only need to store and com‐\\nmunicate parameters, not perform intensive computations.\\nMultiple Devices Across Multiple Servers \\n| \\n327\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

In reality, all rep‐\\nlicas are equivalent: they all work hard to be among the fastest at each training step, and the losers vary at\\nevery step (unless some devices are really slower than others).\\nSynchronous updates\\nWith synchronous updates, the aggregator waits for all gradients to be available before\\ncomputing the average and applying the result (i.e., using the aggregated gradients to\\nupdate the model parameters). Once a replica has finished computing its gradients, it\\nmust wait for the parameters to be updated before it can proceed to the next mini-\\nbatch. The downside is that some devices may be slower than others, so all other\\ndevices will have to wait for them at every step. Moreover, the parameters will be\\ncopied to every device almost at the same time (immediately after the gradients are\\napplied), which may saturate the parameter servers’ bandwidth.\\nTo reduce the waiting time at each step, you could ignore the gradi‐\\nents from the slowest few replicas (typically ~10%). For example,\\nyou could run 20 replicas, but only aggregate the gradients from\\nthe fastest 18 replicas at each step, and just ignore the gradients\\nfrom the last 2. As soon as the parameters are updated, the first 18\\nreplicas can start working again immediately, without having to\\nwait for the 2 slowest replicas. This setup is generally described as\\nhaving 18 replicas plus 2 spare replicas.5\\nAsynchronous updates\\nWith asynchronous updates, whenever a replica has finished computing the gradi‐\\nents, it immediately uses them to update the model parameters. There is no aggrega‐\\ntion (remove the “mean” step in Figure 12-17), and no synchronization. Replicas just\\nwork independently of the other replicas. Since there is no waiting for the other repli‐\\ncas, this approach runs more training steps per minute. Moreover, although the\\nparameters still need to be copied to every device at every step, this happens at differ‐\\nent times for each replica so the risk of bandwidth saturation is reduced.\\nData parallelism with asynchronous updates is an attractive choice, because of its\\nsimplicity, the absence of synchronization delay, and a better use of the bandwidth.\\nHowever, although it works reasonably well in practice, it is almost surprising that it\\nworks at all! Indeed, by the time a replica has finished computing the gradients based\\non some parameter values, these parameters will have been updated several times by\\nother replicas (on average N – 1 times if there are N replicas) and there is no guaran‐\\ntee that the computed gradients will still be pointing in the right direction (see\\nFigure 12-18).

At that\\npoint, adding more GPUs will just increase saturation and slow down training.\\nFor some models, typically relatively small and trained on a very\\nlarge training set, you are often better off training the model on a\\nsingle machine with a single GPU.\\nSaturation is more severe for large dense models, since they have a lot of parameters\\nand gradients to transfer. It is less severe for small models (but the parallelization gain\\nis small) and also for large sparse models since the gradients are typically mostly\\nzeros, so they can be communicated efficiently. Jeff Dean, initiator and lead of the\\nGoogle Brain project, reported typical speedups of 25–40x when distributing compu‐\\ntations across 50 GPUs for dense models, and 300x speedup for sparser models\\ntrained across 500 GPUs. As you can see, sparse models really do scale better. Here\\nare a few concrete examples:\\n• Neural Machine Translation: 6x speedup on 8 GPUs\\n• Inception/ImageNet: 32x speedup on 50 GPUs\\n• RankBrain: 300x speedup on 500 GPUs\\nThese numbers represent the state of the art in Q1 2016. Beyond a few dozen GPUs\\nfor a dense model or few hundred GPUs for a sparse model, saturation kicks in and\\nperformance degrades. There is plenty of research going on to solve this problem\\n(exploring peer-to-peer architectures rather than centralized parameter servers, using\\nlossy model compression, optimizing when and what the replicas need to communi‐\\ncate, and so on), so there will likely be a lot of progress in parallelizing neural net‐\\nworks in the next few years.\\nIn the meantime, here are a few simple steps you can take to reduce the saturation\\nproblem:\\n• Group your GPUs on a few servers rather than scattering them across many\\nservers. This will avoid unnecessary network hops.\\n• Shard the parameters across multiple parameter servers (as discussed earlier).\\n• Drop the model parameters’ float precision from 32 bits (tf.float32) to 16 bits\\n(tf.bfloat16).

See\\nPete Warden’s great post on the subject.\\nTensorFlow implementation\\nTo implement data parallelism using TensorFlow, you first need to choose whether\\nyou want in-graph replication or between-graph replication, and whether you want\\nsynchronous updates or asynchronous updates. Let’s look at how you would imple‐\\nment each combination (see the exercises and the Jupyter notebooks for complete\\ncode examples).\\nWith in-graph replication + synchronous updates, you build one big graph contain‐\\ning all the model replicas (placed on different devices), and a few nodes to aggregate\\nall their gradients and feed them to an optimizer. Your code opens a session to the\\ncluster and simply runs the training operation repeatedly.\\nWith in-graph replication + asynchronous updates, you also create one big graph, but\\nwith one optimizer per replica, and you run one thread per replica, repeatedly run‐\\nning the replica’s optimizer.\\nWith between-graph replication + asynchronous updates, you run multiple inde‐\\npendent clients (typically in separate processes), each training the model replica as if\\nit were alone in the world, but the parameters are actually shared with other replicas\\n(using a resource container).\\nWith between-graph replication + synchronous updates, once again you run multiple\\nclients, each training a model replica based on shared parameters, but this time you\\nwrap the optimizer (e.g., a MomentumOptimizer) within a SyncReplicasOptimizer.\\nEach replica uses this optimizer as it would use any other optimizer, but under the\\nhood this optimizer sends the gradients to a set of queues (one per variable), which is\\nread by one of the replica’s SyncReplicasOptimizer, called the chief. The chief aggre‐\\ngates the gradients and applies them, then writes a token to a token queue for each\\nreplica, signaling it that it can go ahead and compute the next gradients. This\\napproach supports having spare replicas.\\nIf you go through the exercises, you will implement each of these four solutions. You\\nwill easily be able to apply what you have learned to train large deep neural networks\\nacross dozens of servers and GPUs!

Why are these tasks so effortless to us humans? The answer lies in the fact that\\nperception largely takes place outside the realm of our consciousness, within special‐\\nized visual, auditory, and other sensory modules in our brains. By the time sensory\\ninformation reaches our consciousness, it is already adorned with high-level features;\\nfor example, when you look at a picture of a cute puppy, you cannot choose not to see\\nthe puppy, or not to notice its cuteness. Nor can you explain how you recognize a cute\\npuppy; it’s just obvious to you. Thus, we cannot trust our subjective experience: per‐\\nception is not trivial at all, and to understand it we must look at how the sensory\\nmodules work.\\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) emerged from the study of the brain’s visual\\ncortex, and they have been used in image recognition since the 1980s. In the last few\\nyears, thanks to the increase in computational power, the amount of available training\\ndata, and the tricks presented in Chapter 11 for training deep nets, CNNs have man‐\\naged to achieve superhuman performance on some complex visual tasks.

In particular, they showed that many neurons in\\nthe visual cortex have a small local receptive field, meaning they react only to visual\\nstimuli located in a limited region of the visual field (see Figure 13-1, in which the\\nlocal receptive fields of five neurons are represented by dashed circles). The receptive\\nfields of different neurons may overlap, and together they tile the whole visual field.\\nMoreover, the authors showed that some neurons react only to images of horizontal\\nlines, while others react only to lines with different orientations (two neurons may\\nhave the same receptive field but react to different line orientations).

You immediately start running, anticipating the ball’s trajec‐\\ntory. You track it and adapt your movements, and finally catch it (under a thunder of\\napplause). Predicting the future is what you do all the time, whether you are finishing\\na friend’s sentence or anticipating the smell of coffee at breakfast. In this chapter, we\\nare going to discuss recurrent neural networks (RNN), a class of nets that can predict\\nthe future (well, up to a point, of course). They can analyze time series data such as\\nstock prices, and tell you when to buy or sell. In autonomous driving systems, they\\ncan anticipate car trajectories and help avoid accidents. More generally, they can work\\non sequences of arbitrary lengths, rather than on fixed-sized inputs like all the nets we\\nhave discussed so far. For example, they can take sentences, documents, or audio\\nsamples as input, making them extremely useful for natural language processing\\n(NLP) systems such as automatic translation, speech-to-text, or sentiment analysis \\n(e.g., reading movie reviews and extracting the rater’s feeling about the movie).\\nMoreover, RNNs’ ability to anticipate also makes them capable of surprising creativ‐\\nity. You can ask them to predict which are the most likely next notes in a melody, then\\nrandomly pick one of these notes and play it. Then ask the net for the next most likely\\nnotes, play it, and repeat the process again and again. Before you know it, your net\\nwill compose a melody such as the one produced by Google’s Magenta project. Simi‐\\nlarly, RNNs can generate sentences, image captions, and much more. The result is not\\nexactly Shakespeare or Mozart yet, but who knows what they will produce a few years\\nfrom now?\\nIn this chapter, we will look at the fundamental concepts underlying RNNs, the main\\nproblem they face (namely, vanishing/exploding gradients, discussed in Chapter 11),\\nand the solutions widely used to fight it: LSTM and GRU cells. Along the way, as\\nalways, we will show how to implement RNNs using TensorFlow.

Now let’s look at how to create the\\nsame model using TensorFlow’s RNN operations.\\nStatic Unrolling Through Time\\nThe static_rnn() function creates an unrolled RNN network by chaining cells. The\\nfollowing code creates the exact same model as the previous one:\\nX0 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, n_inputs])\\nX1 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, n_inputs])\\nbasic_cell = tf.contrib.rnn.BasicRNNCell(num_units=n_neurons)\\noutput_seqs, states = tf.contrib.rnn.static_rnn(\\n                          basic_cell, [X0, X1], dtype=tf.float32)\\nY0, Y1 = output_seqs\\nFirst we create the input placeholders, as before. Then we create a BasicRNNCell,\\nwhich you can think of as a factory that creates copies of the cell to build the unrolled\\nRNN (one for each time step). Then we call static_rnn(), giving it the cell factory\\nand the input tensors, and telling it the data type of the inputs (this is used to create\\nthe initial state matrix, which by default is full of zeros). The static_rnn() function\\ncalls the cell factory’s __call__() function once per input, creating two copies of the\\ncell (each containing a layer of five recurrent neurons), with shared weights and bias\\nterms, and it chains them just like we did earlier. The static_rnn() function returns\\ntwo objects. The first is a Python list containing the output tensors for each time step.\\nThe second is a tensor containing the final states of the network. When you are using\\nbasic cells, the final state is simply equal to the last output.\\nIf there were 50 time steps, it would not be very convenient to have to define 50 input\\nplaceholders and 50 output tensors. Moreover, at execution time you would have to\\nfeed each of the 50 placeholders and manipulate the 50 outputs. Let’s simplify this.\\nThe following code builds the same RNN again, but this time it takes a single input\\nplaceholder of shape [None, n_steps, n_inputs] where the first dimension is the\\nmini-batch size. Then it extracts the list of input sequences for each time step. X_seqs\\nis a Python list of n_steps tensors of shape [None, n_inputs], where once again the\\nfirst dimension is the mini-batch size. To do this, we first swap the first two dimen‐\\nsions using the transpose() function, so that the time steps are now the first dimen‐\\nsion.

Unfortunately, if you want to\\ntrain an RNN on long sequences, things will get a bit harder. Let’s see why and what\\nyou can do about it.\\nThe Difficulty of Training over Many Time Steps\\nTo train an RNN on long sequences, you will need to run it over many time steps,\\nmaking the unrolled RNN a very deep network. Just like any deep neural network it\\nmay suffer from the vanishing/exploding gradients problem (discussed in Chap‐\\nter 11) and take forever to train. Many of the tricks we discussed to alleviate this\\nproblem can be used for deep unrolled RNNs as well: good parameter initialization,\\nnonsaturating activation functions (e.g., ReLU), Batch Normalization, Gradient Clip‐\\nping, and faster optimizers. However, if the RNN needs to handle even moderately\\nlong sequences (e.g., 100 inputs), then training will still be very slow.\\nThe simplest and most common solution to this problem is to unroll the RNN only\\nover a limited number of time steps during training. This is called truncated backpro‐\\npagation through time. In TensorFlow you can implement it simply by truncating the\\ninput sequences. For example, in the time series prediction problem, you would sim‐\\nply reduce n_steps during training. The problem, of course, is that the model will\\nnot be able to learn long-term patterns. One workaround could be to make sure that\\nthese shortened sequences contain both old and recent data, so that the model can\\nlearn to use both (e.g., the sequence could contain monthly data for the last five\\nmonths, then weekly data for the last five weeks, then daily data over the last five\\ndays). But this workaround has its limits: what if fine-grained data from last year is\\nactually useful? What if there was a brief but significant event that absolutely must be\\ntaken into account, even years later (e.g., the result of an election)?\\nBesides the long training time, a second problem faced by long-running RNNs is the\\nfact that the memory of the first inputs gradually fades away. Indeed, due to the trans‐\\nformations that the data goes through when traversing an RNN, some information is\\nlost after each time step. After a while, the RNN’s state contains virtually no trace of\\nthe first inputs. This can be a showstopper. For example, say you want to perform\\nsentiment analysis on a long review that starts with the four words “I loved this\\nmovie,” but the rest of the review lists the many things that could have made the\\nmovie even better. If the RNN gradually forgets the first four words, it will completely\\nmisinterpret the review. To solve this problem, various types of cells with long-term\\nmemory have been introduced. They have proved so successful that the basic cells are\\nnot much used anymore. Let’s first look at the most popular of these long memory\\ncells: the LSTM cell.\\n400 \\n| \\nChapter 14: Recurrent Neural Networks\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

You\\ncan think of h(t) as the short-term state and c(t) as the long-term state.\\nNow let’s open the box! The key idea is that the network can learn what to store in the\\nlong-term state, what to throw away, and what to read from it. As the long-term state\\nc(t–1) traverses the network from left to right, you can see that it first goes through a\\nforget gate, dropping some memories, and then it adds some new memories via the\\naddition operation (which adds the memories that were selected by an input gate).\\nThe result c(t) is sent straight out, without any further transformation. So, at each time\\nstep, some memories are dropped and some memories are added. Moreover, after the\\naddition operation, the long-term state is copied and passed through the tanh func‐\\ntion, and then the result is filtered by the output gate. This produces the short-term\\nstate h(t) (which is equal to the cell’s output for this time step y(t)). Now let’s look at\\nwhere new memories come from and how the gates work.\\nFirst, the current input vector x(t) and the previous short-term state h(t–1) are fed to\\nfour different fully connected layers. They all serve a different purpose:\\n• The main layer is the one that outputs g(t). It has the usual role of analyzing the\\ncurrent inputs x(t) and the previous (short-term) state h(t–1). In a basic cell, there is\\nnothing else than this layer, and its output goes straight out to y(t) and h(t). In con‐\\ntrast, in an LSTM cell this layer’s output does not go straight out, but instead it is\\npartially stored in the long-term state.\\n• The three other layers are gate controllers. Since they use the logistic activation\\nfunction, their outputs range from 0 to 1. As you can see, their outputs are fed to\\nelement-wise multiplication operations, so if they output 0s, they close the gate,\\nand if they output 1s, they open it. Specifically:\\n— The forget gate (controlled by f(t)) controls which parts of the long-term state\\nshould be erased.\\n— The input gate (controlled by i(t)) controls which parts of g(t) should be added\\nto the long-term state (this is why we said it was only “partially stored”).\\n— Finally, the output gate (controlled by o(t)) controls which parts of the long-\\nterm state should be read and output at this time step (both to h(t)) and y(t).\\nIn short, an LSTM cell can learn to recognize an important input (that’s the role of the\\ninput gate), store it in the long-term state, learn to preserve it for as long as it is\\nneeded (that’s the role of the forget gate), and learn to extract it whenever it is needed.\\nThis explains why they have been amazingly successful at capturing long-term pat‐\\nterns in time series, long texts, audio recordings, and more.\\n402 \\n| \\nChapter 14: Recurrent Neural Networks\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Ideally, you want similar words to\\nhave similar representations, making it easy for the model to generalize what it learns\\nabout a word to all similar words.

But how can you come up with such a meaningful rep‐\\nresentation?\\nThe most common solution is to represent each word in the vocabulary using a fairly\\nsmall and dense vector (e.g., 150 dimensions), called an embedding, and just let the\\nneural network learn a good embedding for each word during training. At the begin‐\\nning of training, embeddings are simply chosen randomly, but during training, back‐\\npropagation automatically moves the embeddings around in a way that helps the\\nneural network perform its task. Typically this means that similar words will gradu‐\\nally cluster close to one another, and even end up organized in a rather meaningful\\nway. For example, embeddings may end up placed along various axes that represent\\ngender, singular/plural, adjective/noun, and so on. The result can be truly amazing.9\\nIn TensorFlow, you first need to create the variable representing the embeddings for\\nevery word in your vocabulary (initialized randomly):\\nvocabulary_size = 50000\\nembedding_size = 150\\nembeddings = tf.Variable(\\n    tf.random_uniform([vocabulary_size, embedding_size], -1.0, 1.0))\\nNow suppose you want to feed the sentence “I drink milk” to your neural network.\\nYou should first preprocess the sentence and break it into a list of known words. For\\nexample you may remove unnecessary characters, replace unknown words by a pre‐\\ndefined token word such as “[UNK]”, replace numerical values by “[NUM]”, replace\\nURLs by “[URL]”, and so on. Once you have a list of known words, you can look up\\neach word’s integer identifier (from 0 to 49999) in a dictionary, for example [72, 3335,\\n288]. At that point, you are ready to feed these word identifiers to TensorFlow using a\\nplaceholder, and apply the embedding_lookup() function to get the corresponding\\nembeddings:\\ntrain_inputs = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None])  # from ids...\\nembed = tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embeddings, train_inputs)  # ...to embeddings\\nOnce your model has learned good word embeddings, they can actually be reused\\nfairly efficiently in any NLP application: after all, “milk” is still close to “water” and far\\nfrom “shoes” no matter what your application is. In fact, instead of training your own\\nword embeddings, you may want to download pretrained word embeddings. Just like\\nwhen reusing pretrained layers (see Chapter 11), you can choose to freeze the pre‐\\ntrained embeddings (e.g., creating the embeddings variable using trainable=False)\\nor let backpropagation tweak them for your application. The first option will speed\\nup training, but the second may lead to slightly higher performance.\\n406 \\n| \\nChapter 14: Recurrent Neural Networks\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

(2015).\\n• First, so far we have assumed that all input sequences (to the encoder and to the\\ndecoder) have a constant length. But obviously sentence lengths may vary. There\\nare several ways that this can be handled—for example, using the\\nsequence_length argument to the static_rnn() or dynamic_rnn() functions to\\nspecify each sentence’s length (as discussed earlier). However, another approach\\nis used in the tutorial (presumably for performance reasons): sentences are grou‐\\nped into buckets of similar lengths (e.g., a bucket for the 1- to 6-word sentences,\\nanother for the 7- to 12-word sentences, and so on11), and the shorter sentences\\nare padded using a special padding token (e.g., “<pad>”). For example “I drink\\nmilk” becomes “<pad> <pad> <pad> milk drink I”, and its translation becomes\\n“Je bois du lait <eos> <pad>”. Of course, we want to ignore any output past the\\nEOS token. For this, the tutorial’s implementation uses a target_weights vector.\\nFor example, for the target sentence “Je bois du lait <eos> <pad>”, the weights\\nwould be set to [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0] (notice the weight 0.0 that\\ncorresponds to the padding token in the target sentence). Simply multiplying the\\nlosses by the target weights will zero out the losses that correspond to words past\\nEOS tokens.\\n• Second, when the output vocabulary is large (which is the case here), outputting\\na probability for each and every possible word would be terribly slow. If the tar‐\\nget vocabulary contains, say, 50,000 French words, then the decoder would out‐\\nput 50,000-dimensional vectors, and then computing the softmax function over\\nsuch a large vector would be very computationally intensive. To avoid this, one\\nsolution is to let the decoder output much smaller vectors, such as 1,000-\\ndimensional vectors, then use a sampling technique to estimate the loss without\\nhaving to compute it over every single word in the target vocabulary. This Sam‐\\npled Softmax technique was introduced in 2015 by Sébastien Jean et al.12 In Ten‐\\nsorFlow you can use the sampled_softmax_loss() function.\\n• Third, the tutorial’s implementation uses an attention mechanism that lets the\\ndecoder peek into the input sequence. Attention augmented RNNs are beyond\\nthe scope of this book, but if you are interested there are helpful papers about\\nmachine translation,13 machine reading,14 and image captions15 using attention.\\n• Finally, the tutorial’s implementation makes use of the tf.nn.legacy_seq2seq\\nmodule, which provides tools to build various Encoder–Decoder models easily.\\nNatural Language Processing \\n| \\n409\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

These codings typically have a much lower dimensionality than the input\\ndata, making autoencoders useful for dimensionality reduction (see Chapter 8). More\\nimportantly, autoencoders act as powerful feature detectors, and they can be used for\\nunsupervised pretraining of deep neural networks (as we discussed in Chapter 11).\\nLastly, they are capable of randomly generating new data that looks very similar to the\\ntraining data; this is called a generative model. For example, you could train an\\nautoencoder on pictures of faces, and it would then be able to generate new faces.\\nSurprisingly, autoencoders work by simply learning to copy their inputs to their out‐\\nputs. This may sound like a trivial task, but we will see that constraining the network\\nin various ways can make it rather difficult. For example, you can limit the size of the\\ninternal representation, or you can add noise to the inputs and train the network to\\nrecover the original inputs. These constraints prevent the autoencoder from trivially\\ncopying the inputs directly to the outputs, which forces it to learn efficient ways of\\nrepresenting the data. In short, the codings are byproducts of the autoencoder’s\\nattempt to learn the identity function under some constraints.\\nIn this chapter we will explain in more depth how autoencoders work, what types of\\nconstraints can be imposed, and how to implement them using TensorFlow, whether\\nit is for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, unsupervised pretraining, or as\\ngenerative models.\\n411\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Chase and H. Simon (1973).\\nEfficient Data Representations\\nWhich of the following number sequences do you find the easiest to memorize?\\n• 40, 27, 25, 36, 81, 57, 10, 73, 19, 68\\n• 50, 25, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20\\nAt first glance, it would seem that the first sequence should be easier, since it is much\\nshorter. However, if you look carefully at the second sequence, you may notice that it\\nfollows two simple rules: even numbers are followed by their half, and odd numbers\\nare followed by their triple plus one (this is a famous sequence known as the hailstone\\nsequence). Once you notice this pattern, the second sequence becomes much easier to\\nmemorize than the first because you only need to memorize the two rules, the first\\nnumber, and the length of the sequence. Note that if you could quickly and easily\\nmemorize very long sequences, you would not care much about the existence of a\\npattern in the second sequence. You would just learn every number by heart, and that\\nwould be that. It is the fact that it is hard to memorize long sequences that makes it\\nuseful to recognize patterns, and hopefully this clarifies why constraining an autoen‐\\ncoder during training pushes it to discover and exploit patterns in the data.\\nThe relationship between memory, perception, and pattern matching was famously\\nstudied by William Chase and Herbert Simon in the early 1970s.1 They observed that\\nexpert chess players were able to memorize the positions of all the pieces in a game by\\nlooking at the board for just 5 seconds, a task that most people would find impossible.\\nHowever, this was only the case when the pieces were placed in realistic positions\\n(from actual games), not when the pieces were placed randomly. Chess experts don’t\\nhave a much better memory than you and I, they just see chess patterns more easily\\nthanks to their experience with the game. Noticing patterns helps them store infor‐\\nmation efficiently.\\nJust like the chess players in this memory experiment, an autoencoder looks at the\\ninputs, converts them to an efficient internal representation, and then spits out some‐\\nthing that (hopefully) looks very close to the inputs. An autoencoder is always com‐\\nposed of two parts: an encoder (or recognition network) that converts the inputs to an\\ninternal representation, followed by a decoder (or generative network) that converts\\nthe internal representation to the outputs (see Figure 15-1).\\nAs you can see, an autoencoder typically has the same architecture as a Multi-Layer\\nPerceptron (MLP; see Chapter 10), except that the number of neurons in the output\\nlayer must be equal to the number of inputs. In this example, there is just one hidden\\n412 \\n| \\nChapter 15: Autoencoders\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Let’s take a look.\\nVisualizing Features\\nOnce your autoencoder has learned some features, you may want to take a look at\\nthem. There are various techniques for this. Arguably the simplest technique is to\\nconsider each neuron in every hidden layer, and find the training instances that acti‐\\nvate it the most. This is especially useful for the top hidden layers since they often\\ncapture relatively large features that you can easily spot in a group of training instan‐\\nces that contain them. For example, if a neuron strongly activates when it sees a cat in\\na picture, it will be pretty obvious that the pictures that activate it the most all contain\\ncats. However, for lower layers, this technique does not work so well, as the features\\nare smaller and more abstract, so it’s often hard to understand exactly what the neu‐\\nron is getting all excited about.\\nLet’s look at another technique. For each neuron in the first hidden layer, you can cre‐\\nate an image where a pixel’s intensity corresponds to the weight of the connection to\\nthe given neuron. For example, the following code plots the features learned by five\\nneurons in the first hidden layer:\\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\\n    [...] # train autoencoder\\nStacked Autoencoders \\n| \\n421\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

This makes it possible to train\\na high-performance model using only little training data because your neural net‐\\nwork won’t have to learn all the low-level features; it will just reuse the feature detec‐\\ntors learned by the existing net.\\nSimilarly, if you have a large dataset but most of it is unlabeled, you can first train a\\nstacked autoencoder using all the data, then reuse the lower layers to create a neural\\nnetwork for your actual task, and train it using the labeled data. For example,\\nFigure 15-8 shows how to use a stacked autoencoder to perform unsupervised pre‐\\ntraining for a classification neural network.

Luckily, the equations sim‐\\nplify to the following code for the latent loss:7\\neps = 1e-10  # smoothing term to avoid computing log(0) which is NaN\\nlatent_loss = 0.5 * tf.reduce_sum(\\n    tf.square(hidden3_sigma) + tf.square(hidden3_mean)\\n    - 1 - tf.log(eps + tf.square(hidden3_sigma)))\\nOne common variant is to train the encoder to output γ = log(σ2) rather than σ.\\nWherever we need σ we can just compute σ = exp\\nγ\\n2 . This makes it a bit easier for\\nthe encoder to capture sigmas of different scales, and thus it helps speed up conver‐\\ngence. The latent loss ends up a bit simpler:\\nlatent_loss = 0.5 * tf.reduce_sum(\\n    tf.exp(hidden3_gamma) + tf.square(hidden3_mean) - 1 - hidden3_gamma)\\nThe following code builds the variational autoencoder shown in Figure 15-11 (left), \\nusing the log(σ2) variant:\\nn_inputs = 28 * 28  # for MNIST\\nn_hidden1 = 500\\nn_hidden2 = 500\\nn_hidden3 = 20  # codings\\nn_hidden4 = n_hidden2\\nn_hidden5 = n_hidden1\\nn_outputs = n_inputs\\nlearning_rate = 0.001\\nwith tf.contrib.framework.arg_scope(\\n        [fully_connected],\\n        activation_fn=tf.nn.elu,\\n        weights_initializer=tf.contrib.layers.variance_scaling_initializer()):\\n    X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, n_inputs])\\n430 \\n| \\nChapter 15: Autoencoders\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Salakhutdinov and G. Hinton (2008).\\n8. Let’s use a denoising autoencoder to pretrain an image classifier:\\n• You can use MNIST (simplest), or another large set of images such as CIFAR10\\nif you want a bigger challenge. If you choose CIFAR10, you need to write code\\nto load batches of images for training. If you want to skip this part, Tensor‐\\nFlow’s model zoo contains tools to do just that.\\n• Split the dataset into a training set and a test set. Train a deep denoising\\nautoencoder on the full training set.\\n• Check that the images are fairly well reconstructed, and visualize the low-level\\nfeatures. Visualize the images that most activate each neuron in the coding\\nlayer.\\n• Build a classification deep neural network, reusing the lower layers of the\\nautoencoder. Train it using only 10% of the training set. Can you get it to per‐\\nform as well as the same classifier trained on the full training set?\\n9. Semantic hashing, introduced in 2008 by Ruslan Salakhutdinov and Geoffrey\\nHinton,13 is a technique used for efficient information retrieval: a document (e.g.,\\nan image) is passed through a system, typically a neural network, which outputs a\\nfairly low-dimensional binary vector (e.g., 30 bits). Two similar documents are\\nlikely to have identical or very similar hashes. By indexing each document using\\nits hash, it is possible to retrieve many documents similar to a particular docu‐\\nment almost instantly, even if there are billions of documents: just compute the\\nhash of the document and look up all documents with that same hash (or hashes\\ndiffering by just one or two bits). Let’s implement semantic hashing using a\\nslightly tweaked stacked autoencoder:\\n• Create a stacked autoencoder containing two hidden layers below the coding\\nlayer, and train it on the image dataset you used in the previous exercise. The\\ncoding layer should contain 30 neurons and use the logistic activation function\\nto output values between 0 and 1. After training, to produce the hash of an\\nimage, you can simply run it through the autoencoder, take the output of the\\ncoding layer, and round every value to the closest integer (0 or 1).\\n• One neat trick proposed by Salakhutdinov and Hinton is to add Gaussian\\nnoise (with zero mean) to the inputs of the coding layer, during training only.\\nIn order to preserve a high signal-to-noise ratio, the autoencoder will learn to\\nfeed large values to the coding layer (so that the noise becomes negligible). In\\nturn, this means that the logistic function of the coding layer will likely satu‐\\nrate at 0 or 1. As a result, rounding the codings to 0 or 1 won’t distort them too\\nmuch, and this will improve the reliability of the hashes.\\n434 \\n| \\nChapter 15: Autoencoders\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

It has been around since the 1950s, producing many\\ninteresting applications over the years,1 in particular in games (e.g., TD-Gammon, a\\nBackgammon playing program) and in machine control, but seldom making the\\nheadline news. But a revolution took place in 2013 when researchers from an English\\nstartup called DeepMind demonstrated a system that could learn to play just about\\nany Atari game from scratch,2 eventually outperforming humans3 in most of them,\\nusing only raw pixels as inputs and without any prior knowledge of the rules of the\\ngames.4 This was the first of a series of amazing feats, culminating in March 2016\\nwith the victory of their system AlphaGo against Lee Sedol, the world champion of\\nthe game of Go. No program had ever come close to beating a master of this game, let\\nalone the world champion. Today the whole field of RL is boiling with new ideas, with\\na wide range of applications. DeepMind was bought by Google for over 500 million\\ndollars in 2014.\\nSo how did they do it? With hindsight it seems rather simple: they applied the power\\nof Deep Learning to the field of Reinforcement Learning, and it worked beyond their\\nwildest dreams. In this chapter we will first explain what Reinforcement Learning is\\nand what it is good at, and then we will present two of the most important techniques\\nin deep Reinforcement Learning: policy gradients and deep Q-networks (DQN),\\n437\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

The same techniques can be used for a wide variety of tasks, from walking\\nrobots to self-driving cars.\\nLearning to Optimize Rewards\\nIn Reinforcement Learning, a software agent makes observations and takes actions\\nwithin an environment, and in return it receives rewards. Its objective is to learn to act\\nin a way that will maximize its expected long-term rewards. If you don’t mind a bit of\\nanthropomorphism, you can think of positive rewards as pleasure, and negative\\nrewards as pain (the term “reward” is a bit misleading in this case). In short, the agent\\nacts in the environment and learns by trial and error to maximize its pleasure and\\nminimize its pain.\\nThis is quite a broad setting, which can apply to a wide variety of tasks. Here are a few\\nexamples (see Figure 16-1):\\na. The agent can be the program controlling a walking robot. In this case, the envi‐\\nronment is the real world, the agent observes the environment through a set of\\nsensors such as cameras and touch sensors, and its actions consist of sending sig‐\\nnals to activate motors. It may be programmed to get positive rewards whenever\\nit approaches the target destination, and negative rewards whenever it wastes\\ntime, goes in the wrong direction, or falls down.\\nb. The agent can be the program controlling Ms. Pac-Man. In this case, the environ‐\\nment is a simulation of the Atari game, the actions are the nine possible joystick\\npositions (upper left, down, center, and so on), the observations are screenshots,\\nand the rewards are just the game points.\\nc. Similarly, the agent can be the program playing a board game such as the game of\\nGo.\\nd. The agent does not have to control a physically (or virtually) moving thing. For\\nexample, it can be a smart thermostat, getting rewards whenever it is close to the\\ntarget temperature and saves energy, and negative rewards when humans need to\\ntweak the temperature, so the agent must learn to anticipate human needs.\\ne. The agent can observe stock market prices and decide how much to buy or sell\\nevery second. Rewards are obviously the monetary gains and losses.\\n438 \\n| \\nChapter 16: Reinforcement Learning\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Reinforcement Learning using a neural network policy\\nThe policy can be any algorithm you can think of, and it does not even have to be\\ndeterministic.

Its policy could be to move forward with\\nsome probability p every second, or randomly rotate left or right with probability 1 –\\np. The rotation angle would be a random angle between –r and +r. Since this policy\\ninvolves some randomness, it is called a stochastic policy.

It would just be regular supervised learning. However, in Reinforce‐\\nment Learning the only guidance the agent gets is through rewards, and rewards are\\ntypically sparse and delayed. For example, if the agent manages to balance the pole\\nfor 100 steps, how can it know which of the 100 actions it took were good, and which\\nof them were bad? All it knows is that the pole fell after the last action, but surely this\\nlast action is not entirely responsible. This is called the credit assignment problem:\\nwhen the agent gets a reward, it is hard for it to know which actions should get credi‐\\nted (or blamed) for it. Think of a dog that gets rewarded hours after it behaved well;\\nwill it understand what it is rewarded for?\\nTo tackle this problem, a common strategy is to evaluate an action based on the sum\\nof all the rewards that come after it, usually applying a discount rate r at each step. For\\nexample (see Figure 16-6), if an agent decides to go right three times in a row and gets\\n+10 reward after the first step, 0 after the second step, and finally –50 after the third\\nstep, then assuming we use a discount rate r = 0.8, the first action will have a total\\nscore of 10 + r × 0 + r2 × (–50) = –22. If the discount rate is close to 0, then future\\nrewards won’t count for much compared to immediate rewards. Conversely, if the \\ndiscount rate is close to 1, then rewards far into the future will count almost as much\\nas immediate rewards. Typical discount rates are 0.95 or 0.99. With a discount rate of\\n0.95, rewards 13 steps into the future count roughly for half as much as immediate\\nrewards (since 0.9513 ≈ 0.5), while with a discount rate of 0.99, rewards 69 steps into\\nthe future count for half as much as immediate rewards. In the CartPole environ‐\\nment, actions have fairly short-term effects, so choosing a discount rate of 0.95 seems\\nreasonable.\\nEvaluating Actions: The Credit Assignment Problem \\n| \\n447\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

This is because we want to tweak the gradients before we apply\\nthem.10 The compute_gradients() method returns a list of gradient vector/variable\\npairs (one pair per trainable variable). Let’s put all the gradients in a list, to make it\\nmore convenient to obtain their values:\\ngradients = [grad for grad, variable in grads_and_vars]\\nOkay, now comes the tricky part. During the execution phase, the algorithm will run\\nthe policy and at each step it will evaluate these gradient tensors and store their val‐\\nues. After a number of episodes it will tweak these gradients as explained earlier (i.e.,\\nmultiply them by the action scores and normalize them) and compute the mean of\\nthe tweaked gradients. Next, it will need to feed the resulting gradients back to the\\nPolicy Gradients \\n| \\n449\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Suppose that the\\nprocess starts in state s0, and there is a 70% chance that it will remain in that state at\\nthe next step. Eventually it is bound to leave that state and never come back since no\\nother state points back to s0. If it goes to state s1, it will then most likely go to state s2\\n(90% probability), then immediately back to state s1 (with 100% probability). It may\\nalternate a number of times between these two states, but eventually it will fall into\\nstate s3 and remain there forever (this is a terminal state).

Bellman (1957).\\nFigure 16-7. Example of a Markov chain\\nMarkov decision processes were first described in the 1950s by Richard Bellman.11\\nThey resemble Markov chains but with a twist: at each step, an agent can choose one\\nof several possible actions, and the transition probabilities depend on the chosen\\naction. Moreover, some state transitions return some reward (positive or negative),\\nand the agent’s goal is to find a policy that will maximize rewards over time.\\nFor example, the MDP represented in Figure 16-8 has three states and up to three\\npossible discrete actions at each step. If it starts in state s0, the agent can choose\\nbetween actions a0, a1, or a2. If it chooses action a1, it just remains in state s0 with cer‐\\ntainty, and without any reward. It can thus decide to stay there forever if it wants. But\\nif it chooses action a0, it has a 70% probability of gaining a reward of +10, and\\nremaining in state s0. It can then try again and again to gain as much reward as possi‐\\nble. But at one point it is going to end up instead in state s1. In state s1 it has only two\\npossible actions: a0 or a1. It can choose to stay put by repeatedly choosing action a1, or\\nit can choose to move on to state s2 and get a negative reward of –50 (ouch). In state s3\\nit has no other choice than to take action a1, which will most likely lead it back to\\nstate s0, gaining a reward of +40 on the way. You get the picture. By looking at this\\nMDP, can you guess which strategy will gain the most reward over time? In state s0 it\\nis clear that action a0 is the best option, and in state s3 the agent has no choice but to\\ntake action a1, but in state s1 it is not obvious whether the agent should stay put (a0) or\\ngo through the fire (a2).\\n454 \\n| \\nChapter 16: Reinforcement Learning\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Can we do better?\\nExploration Policies\\nOf course Q-Learning can work only if the exploration policy explores the MDP\\nthoroughly enough. Although a purely random policy is guaranteed to eventually\\nvisit every state and every transition many times, it may take an extremely long time\\nto do so. Therefore, a better option is to use the ε-greedy policy: at each step it acts\\nrandomly with probability ε, or greedily (choosing the action with the highest Q-\\nValue) with probability 1-ε. The advantage of the ε-greedy policy (compared to a\\ncompletely random policy) is that it will spend more and more time exploring the\\ninteresting parts of the environment, as the Q-Value estimates get better and better,\\nwhile still spending some time visiting unknown regions of the MDP. It is quite com‐\\nmon to start with a high value for ε (e.g., 1.0) and then gradually reduce it (e.g., down\\nto 0.05).\\nAlternatively, rather than relying on chance for exploration, another approach is to\\nencourage the exploration policy to try actions that it has not tried much before. This\\ncan be implemented as a bonus added to the Q-Value estimates, as shown in Equation\\n16-6.\\nTemporal Difference Learning and Q-Learning \\n| \\n459\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Consider trying to use Q-Learning to\\ntrain an agent to play Ms. Pac-Man. There are over 250 pellets that Ms. Pac-Man can\\neat, each of which can be present or absent (i.e., already eaten). So the number of pos‐\\nsible states is greater than 2250 ≈ 1075 (and that’s considering the possible states only of\\nthe pellets). This is way more than atoms in the observable universe, so there’s abso‐\\nlutely no way you can keep track of an estimate for every single Q-Value.\\nThe solution is to find a function that approximates the Q-Values using a manageable\\nnumber of parameters. This is called Approximate Q-Learning. For years it was rec‐\\nommended to use linear combinations of hand-crafted features extracted from the\\nstate (e.g., distance of the closest ghosts, their directions, and so on) to estimate Q-\\nValues, but DeepMind showed that using deep neural networks can work much bet‐\\nter, especially for complex problems, and it does not require any feature engineering.\\nA DNN used to estimate Q-Values is called a deep Q-network (DQN), and using a\\nDQN for Approximate Q-Learning is called Deep Q-Learning.\\nIn the rest of this chapter, we will use Deep Q-Learning to train an agent to play Ms.\\nPac-Man, much like DeepMind did in 2013.

Plus we have an operation\\ncalled copy_critic_to_actor to copy all the trainable variables of the critic DQN to\\nthe actor DQN. We use TensorFlow’s tf.group() function to group all the assign‐\\nment operations into a single convenient operation.\\nThe actor DQN can be used to play Ms. Pac-Man (initially very badly). As discussed\\nearlier, you want it to explore the game thoroughly enough, so you generally want to\\ncombine it with an ε-greedy policy or another exploration strategy.\\nBut what about the critic DQN? How will it learn to play the game? The short answer\\nis that it will try to make its Q-Value predictions match the Q-Values estimated by the\\nactor through its experience of the game. Specifically, we will let the actor play for a\\nwhile, storing all its experiences in a replay memory. Each memory will be a 5-tuple\\n(state, action, next state, reward, continue), where the “continue” item will be equal to\\n0.0 when the game is over, or 1.0 otherwise.

Model-based learning algorithms search for an optimal value for the model\\nparameters such that the model will generalize well to new instances. We usually\\ntrain such systems by minimizing a cost function that measures how bad the sys‐\\ntem is at making predictions on the training data, plus a penalty for model com‐\\nplexity if the model is regularized. To make predictions, we feed the new\\ninstance’s features into the model’s prediction function, using the parameter val‐\\nues found by the learning algorithm.\\n14. Some of the main challenges in Machine Learning are the lack of data, poor data\\nquality, nonrepresentative data, uninformative features, excessively simple mod‐\\nels that underfit the training data, and excessively complex models that overfit\\nthe data.\\n15. If a model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new\\ninstances, the model is likely overfitting the training data (or we got extremely\\nlucky on the training data). Possible solutions to overfitting are getting more\\ndata, simplifying the model (selecting a simpler algorithm, reducing the number\\nof parameters or features used, or regularizing the model), or reducing the noise\\nin the training data.\\n16. A test set is used to estimate the generalization error that a model will make on\\nnew instances, before the model is launched in production.\\n472 \\n| \\nAppendix A: Exercise Solutions\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

The fundamental idea behind Support Vector Machines is to fit the widest possi‐\\nble “street” between the classes. In other words, the goal is to have the largest pos‐\\nsible margin between the decision boundary that separates the two classes and\\nthe training instances. When performing soft margin classification, the SVM\\nsearches for a compromise between perfectly separating the two classes and hav‐\\ning the widest possible street (i.e., a few instances may end up on the street).\\nAnother key idea is to use kernels when training on nonlinear datasets.\\n2. After training an SVM, a support vector is any instance located on the “street” (see\\nthe previous answer), including its border. The decision boundary is entirely\\ndetermined by the support vectors. Any instance that is not a support vector (i.e.,\\noff the street) has no influence whatsoever; you could remove them, add more\\ninstances, or move them around, and as long as they stay off the street they won’t\\naffect the decision boundary. Computing the predictions only involves the sup‐\\nport vectors, not the whole training set.\\n3. SVMs try to fit the largest possible “street” between the classes (see the first\\nanswer), so if the training set is not scaled, the SVM will tend to neglect small\\nfeatures (see Figure 5-2).\\n4. An SVM classifier can output the distance between the test instance and the deci‐\\nsion boundary, and you can use this as a confidence score. However, this score\\ncannot be directly converted into an estimation of the class probability. If you set\\nprobability=True when creating an SVM in Scikit-Learn, then after training it\\nwill calibrate the probabilities using Logistic Regression on the SVM’s scores\\n(trained by an additional five-fold cross-validation on the training data).

However, each predictor in a boosting ensemble is built based on\\nthe previous predictor, so training is necessarily sequential, and you will not gain\\nanything by distributing training across multiple servers. Regarding stacking\\nensembles, all the predictors in a given layer are independent of each other, so\\nthey can be trained in parallel on multiple servers. However, the predictors in one\\nlayer can only be trained after the predictors in the previous layer have all been\\ntrained.\\n4. With out-of-bag evaluation, each predictor in a bagging ensemble is evaluated\\nusing instances that it was not trained on (they were held out).

The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that many problems that do not\\nexist in low-dimensional space arise in high-dimensional space. In Machine\\nLearning, one common manifestation is the fact that randomly sampled high-\\ndimensional vectors are generally very sparse, increasing the risk of overfitting\\nand making it very difficult to identify patterns in the data without having plenty\\nof training data.\\n3. Once a dataset’s dimensionality has been reduced using one of the algorithms we\\ndiscussed, it is almost always impossible to perfectly reverse the operation,\\nbecause some information gets lost during dimensionality reduction. Moreover,\\nwhile some algorithms (such as PCA) have a simple reverse transformation pro‐\\ncedure that can reconstruct a dataset relatively similar to the original, other algo‐\\nrithms (such as T-SNE) do not.\\n4. PCA can be used to significantly reduce the dimensionality of most datasets, even\\nif they are highly nonlinear, because it can at least get rid of useless dimensions.\\nHowever, if there are no useless dimensions—for example, the Swiss roll—then\\nreducing dimensionality with PCA will lose too much information. You want to\\nunroll the Swiss roll, not squash it.\\n5. That’s a trick question: it depends on the dataset. Let’s look at two extreme exam‐\\nples. First, suppose the dataset is composed of points that are almost perfectly\\naligned. In this case, PCA can reduce the dataset down to just one dimension\\nwhile still preserving 95% of the variance.

Regular PCA is the default, but it works only if the dataset fits in memory. Incre‐\\nmental PCA is useful for large datasets that don’t fit in memory, but it is slower\\nthan regular PCA, so if the dataset fits in memory you should prefer regular\\nPCA.

A CNN’s architecture embeds this prior\\nknowledge. Lower layers typically identify features in small areas of the images,\\nwhile higher layers combine the lower-level features into larger features. This\\nworks well with most natural images, giving CNNs a decisive head start com‐\\npared to DNNs.\\n2. Let’s compute how many parameters the CNN has. Since its first convolutional\\nlayer has 3 × 3 kernels, and the input has three channels (red, green, and blue),\\nthen each feature map has 3 × 3 × 3 weights, plus a bias term. That’s 28 parame‐\\nters per feature map. Since this first convolutional layer has 100 feature maps, it\\nhas a total of 2,800 parameters. The second convolutional layer has 3 × 3 kernels,\\nand its input is the set of 100 feature maps of the previous layer, so each feature\\nmap has 3 × 3 × 100 = 900 weights, plus a bias term. Since it has 200 feature\\nmaps, this layer has 901 × 200 = 180,200 parameters. Finally, the third and last\\nconvolutional layer also has 3 × 3 kernels, and its input is the set of 200 feature\\nmaps of the previous layers, so each feature map has 3 × 3 × 200 = 1,800 weights,\\nplus a bias term. Since it has 400 feature maps, this layer has a total of 1,801 × 400\\n= 720,400 parameters. All in all, the CNN has 2,800 + 180,200 + 720,400 =\\n903,400 parameters.\\nNow let’s compute how much RAM this neural network will require (at least)\\nwhen making a prediction for a single instance. First let’s compute the feature\\nmap size for each layer. Since we are using a stride of 2 and SAME padding, the\\nhorizontal and vertical size of the feature maps are divided by 2 at each layer\\n(rounding up if necessary), so as the input channels are 200 × 300 pixels, the first\\nlayer’s feature maps are 100 × 150, the second layer’s feature maps are 50 × 75,\\nand the third layer’s feature maps are 25 × 38. Since 32 bits is 4 bytes and the first\\nconvolutional layer has 100 feature maps, this first layer takes up 4 x 100 × 150 ×\\n100 = 6 million bytes (about 5.7 MB, considering that 1 MB = 1,024 KB and 1 KB\\n= 1,024 bytes). The second layer takes up 4 × 50 × 75 × 200 = 3 million bytes\\n(about 2.9 MB). Finally, the third layer takes up 4 × 25 × 38 × 400 = 1,520,000\\nbytes (about 1.4 MB). However, once a layer has been computed, the memory\\noccupied by the previous layer can be released, so if everything is well optimized,\\nonly 6 + 9 = 15 million bytes (about 14.3 MB) of RAM will be required (when the\\nsecond layer has just been computed, but the memory occupied by the first layer\\nis not released yet). But wait, you also need to add the memory occupied by the\\nCNN’s parameters. We computed earlier that it has 903,400 parameters, each\\nusing up 4 bytes, so this adds 3,613,600 bytes (about 3.4 MB). The total RAM\\nrequired is (at least) 18,613,600 bytes (about 17.8 MB).\\nExercise Solutions \\n| \\n489\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

During training TensorFlow uses backpropa‐\\ngation, which requires keeping all values computed during the forward pass until\\nthe reverse pass begins. So we must compute the total RAM required by all layers\\nfor a single instance and multiply that by 50! At that point let’s start counting in\\nmegabytes rather than bytes. We computed before that the three layers require\\nrespectively 5.7, 2.9, and 1.4 MB for each instance. That’s a total of 10.0 MB per\\ninstance. So for 50 instances the total RAM is 500 MB. Add to that the RAM\\nrequired by the input images, which is 50 × 4 × 200 × 300 × 3 = 36 million bytes\\n(about 34.3 MB), plus the RAM required for the model parameters, which is\\nabout 3.4 MB (computed earlier), plus some RAM for the gradients (we will\\nneglect them since they can be released gradually as backpropagation goes down\\nthe layers during the reverse pass). We are up to a total of roughly 500.0 + 34.3 +\\n3.4 = 537.7 MB. And that’s really an optimistic bare minimum.\\n3. If your GPU runs out of memory while training a CNN, here are five things you\\ncould try to solve the problem (other than purchasing a GPU with more RAM):\\n• Reduce the mini-batch size.\\n• Reduce dimensionality using a larger stride in one or more layers.\\n• Remove one or more layers.\\n• Use 16-bit floats instead of 32-bit floats.\\n• Distribute the CNN across multiple devices.\\n4. A max pooling layer has no parameters at all, whereas a convolutional layer has\\nquite a few (see the previous questions).\\n5. A local response normalization layer makes the neurons that most strongly acti‐\\nvate inhibit neurons at the same location but in neighboring feature maps, which\\nencourages different feature maps to specialize and pushes them apart, forcing\\nthem to explore a wider range of features. It is typically used in the lower layers to\\nhave a larger pool of low-level features that the upper layers can build upon.\\n6. The main innovations in AlexNet compared to LeNet-5 are (1) it is much larger\\nand deeper, and (2) it stacks convolutional layers directly on top of each other,\\ninstead of stacking a pooling layer on top of each convolutional layer. The main\\ninnovation in GoogLeNet is the introduction of inception modules, which make it\\npossible to have a much deeper net than previous CNN architectures, with fewer\\nparameters. Finally, ResNet’s main innovation is the introduction of skip connec‐\\ntions, which make it possible to go well beyond 100 layers. Arguably, its simplic‐\\nity and consistency are also rather innovative.\\nFor the solutions to exercises 7, 8, 9, and 10, please see the Jupyter notebooks avail‐\\nable at https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml.\\n490 \\n| \\nAppendix A: Exercise Solutions\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

In general, if you translate a sentence one word at a time, the result will be terri‐\\nble. For example, the French sentence “Je vous en prie” means “You are welcome,”\\nbut if you translate it one word at a time, you get “I you in pray.” Huh? It is much\\nbetter to read the whole sentence first and then translate it. A plain sequence-to-\\nsequence RNN would start translating a sentence immediately after reading the\\nfirst word, while an encoder–decoder RNN will first read the whole sentence and\\nthen translate it. That said, one could imagine a plain sequence-to-sequence\\nRNN that would output silence whenever it is unsure about what to say next (just\\nlike human translators do when they must translate a live broadcast).\\n3. To classify videos based on the visual content, one possible architecture could be\\nto take (say) one frame per second, then run each frame through a convolutional\\nneural network, feed the output of the CNN to a sequence-to-vector RNN, and\\nfinally run its output through a softmax layer, giving you all the class probabili‐\\nties.

The fact that an autoencoder perfectly reconstructs its inputs does not necessarily\\nmean that it is a good autoencoder; perhaps it is simply an overcomplete autoen‐\\ncoder that learned to copy its inputs to the codings layer and then to the outputs.\\nIn fact, even if the codings layer contained a single neuron, it would be possible\\nfor a very deep autoencoder to learn to map each training instance to a different\\ncoding (e.g., the first instance could be mapped to 0.001, the second to 0.002, the\\nthird to 0.003, and so on), and it could learn “by heart” to reconstruct the right\\ntraining instance for each coding. It would perfectly reconstruct its inputs\\nwithout really learning any useful pattern in the data. In practice such a mapping\\nis unlikely to happen, but it illustrates the fact that perfect reconstructions are not\\na guarantee that the autoencoder learned anything useful. However, if it produces\\nvery bad reconstructions, then it is almost guaranteed to be a bad autoencoder.\\nTo evaluate the performance of an autoencoder, one option is to measure the\\nreconstruction loss (e.g., compute the MSE, the mean square of the outputs\\nminus the inputs). Again, a high reconstruction loss is a good sign that the\\nautoencoder is bad, but a low reconstruction loss is not a guarantee that it is\\ngood. You should also evaluate the autoencoder according to what it will be used\\nfor. For example, if you are using it for unsupervised pretraining of a classifier,\\nthen you should also evaluate the classifier’s performance.\\n4. An undercomplete autoencoder is one whose codings layer is smaller than the\\ninput and output layers. If it is larger, then it is an overcomplete autoencoder.\\nThe main risk of an excessively undercomplete autoencoder is that it may fail to\\nreconstruct the inputs. The main risk of an overcomplete autoencoder is that it\\nmay just copy the inputs to the outputs, without learning any useful feature.\\n5. To tie the weights of an encoder layer and its corresponding decoder layer, you\\nsimply make the decoder weights equal to the transpose of the encoder weights.\\nThis reduces the number of parameters in the model by half, often making train‐\\ning converge faster with less training data, and reducing the risk of overfitting the\\ntraining set.\\n6. To visualize the features learned by the lower layer of a stacked autoencoder, a\\ncommon technique is simply to plot the weights of each neuron, by reshaping\\neach weight vector to the size of an input image (e.g., for MNIST, reshaping a\\nweight vector of shape [784] to [28, 28]).

Reinforcement Learning is an area of Machine Learning aimed at creating agents\\ncapable of taking actions in an environment in a way that maximizes rewards\\nover time. There are many differences between RL and regular supervised and\\nunsupervised learning. Here are a few:\\n• In supervised and unsupervised learning, the goal is generally to find patterns\\nin the data. In Reinforcement Learning, the goal is to find a good policy.\\n• Unlike in supervised learning, the agent is not explicitly given the “right”\\nanswer. It must learn by trial and error.\\n• Unlike in unsupervised learning, there is a form of supervision, through\\nrewards. We do not tell the agent how to perform the task, but we do tell it\\nwhen it is making progress or when it is failing.\\n• A Reinforcement Learning agent needs to find the right balance between\\nexploring the environment, looking for new ways of getting rewards, and\\nexploiting sources of rewards that it already knows. In contrast, supervised and\\nunsupervised learning systems generally don’t need to worry about explora‐\\ntion; they just feed on the training data they are given.\\n• In supervised and unsupervised learning, training instances are typically inde‐\\npendent (in fact, they are generally shuffled). In Reinforcement Learning, con‐\\nsecutive observations are generally not independent. An agent may remain in\\nthe same region of the environment for a while before it moves on, so consecu‐\\ntive observations will be very correlated. In some cases a replay memory is\\nused to ensure that the training algorithm gets fairly independent observa‐\\ntions.\\n2. Here are a few possible applications of Reinforcement Learning, other than those\\nmentioned in Chapter 16:\\nMusic personalization\\nThe environment is a user’s personalized web radio. The agent is the software\\ndeciding what song to play next for that user. Its possible actions are to play\\nany song in the catalog (it must try to choose a song the user will enjoy) or to\\nplay an advertisement (it must try to choose an ad that the user will be inter‐\\n494 \\n| \\nAppendix A: Exercise Solutions\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

The agent is the\\nsoftware that defines which customers a mailing campaign should be sent to,\\ngiven their profile and purchase history (for each customer it has two possi‐\\nble actions: send or don’t send). It gets a negative reward for the cost of the\\nmailing campaign, and a positive reward for estimated revenue generated\\nfrom this campaign.\\nProduct delivery\\nLet the agent control a fleet of delivery trucks, deciding what they should\\npick up at the depots, where they should go, what they should drop off, and\\nso on. They would get positive rewards for each product delivered on time,\\nand negative rewards for late deliveries.\\n3. When estimating the value of an action, Reinforcement Learning algorithms typ‐\\nically sum all the rewards that this action led to, giving more weight to immediate\\nrewards, and less weight to later rewards (considering that an action has more\\ninfluence on the near future than on the distant future). To model this, a discount\\nrate is typically applied at each time step. For example, with a discount rate of 0.9,\\na reward of 100 that is received two time steps later is counted as only 0.92 × 100\\n= 81 when you are estimating the value of the action. You can think of the dis‐\\ncount rate as a measure of how much the future is valued relative to the present:\\nif it is very close to 1, then the future is valued almost as much as the present. If it\\nis close to 0, then only immediate rewards matter. Of course, this impacts the\\noptimal policy tremendously: if you value the future, you may be willing to put\\nup with a lot of immediate pain for the prospect of eventual rewards, while if you\\ndon’t value the future, you will just grab any immediate reward you can find,\\nnever investing in the future.\\n4. To measure the performance of a Reinforcement Learning agent, you can simply\\nsum up the rewards it gets. In a simulated environment, you can run many epi‐\\nsodes and look at the total rewards it gets on average (and possibly look at the\\nmin, max, standard deviation, and so on).\\n5. The credit assignment problem is the fact that when a Reinforcement Learning\\nagent receives a reward, it has no direct way of knowing which of its previous\\nactions contributed to this reward. It typically occurs when there is a large delay\\nbetween an action and the resulting rewards (e.g., during a game of Atari’s Pong,\\nthere may be a few dozen time steps between the moment the agent hits the ball\\nand the moment it wins the point). One way to alleviate it is to provide the agent\\nwith shorter-term rewards, when possible.

This can intro‐\\nduce some bias in the learning algorithm. It may tune its policy for this region of\\nthe environment, but it will not perform well as soon as it moves out of this\\nregion.

Let’s look at a\\nsimple example. Suppose you want to find the values of x and y that minimize the\\nfunction f(x,y) = x2 + 2y, subject to an equality constraint: 3x + 2y + 1 = 0. Using the\\nLagrange multipliers method, we start by defining a new function called the Lagran‐\\ngian (or Lagrange function): g(x, y, α) = f(x, y) – α(3x + 2y + 1). Each constraint (in\\nthis case just one) is subtracted from the original objective, multiplied by a new vari‐\\nable called a Lagrange multiplier.\\nJoseph-Louis Lagrange showed that if x, y  is a solution to the constrained optimiza‐\\ntion problem, then there must exist an α such that x, y, α  is a stationary point of the\\nLagrangian (a stationary point is a point where all partial derivatives are equal to\\nzero). In other words, we can compute the partial derivatives of g(x, y, α) with regards\\nto x, y, and α; we can find the points where these derivatives are all equal to zero; and\\nthe solutions to the constrained optimization problem (if they exist) must be among\\nthese stationary points.\\nIn this example the partial derivatives are: \\n∂\\n∂x g x, y, α = 2x −3α\\n∂\\n∂y g x, y, α = 2 −2α\\n∂\\n∂α g x, y, α = −3x −2y −1\\nWhen \\nall \\nthese \\npartial \\nderivatives \\nare \\nequal \\nto \\n0, \\nwe \\nfind \\nthat\\n2x −3α = 2 −2α = −3x −2y −1 = 0, from which we can easily find that x = 3\\n2,\\ny = −11\\n4 , and α = 1. This is the only stationary point, and as it respects the con‐\\nstraint, it must be the solution to the constrained optimization problem.\\n503\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

Carreira-Perpiñán and Geoffrey Hinton.1 Here is how it works: for\\neach training instance x, the algorithm starts by feeding it to the network by setting\\nthe state of the visible units to x1, x2, ⋯, xn. Then you compute the state of the hidden\\nunits by applying the stochastic equation described before (Equation E-1). This gives\\nyou a hidden vector h (where hi is equal to the state of the ith unit). Next you compute\\nthe state of the visible units, by applying the same stochastic equation. This gives you\\na vector �˙. Then once again you compute the state of the hidden units, which gives\\nyou a vector �˙. Now you can update each connection weight by applying the rule in\\nEquation E-2.\\nEquation E-2.

This makes it incomparably more efficient than previous algorithms, and it\\nwas a key ingredient to the first success of Deep Learning based on multiple stacked\\nRBMs.\\nDeep Belief Nets\\nSeveral layers of RBMs can be stacked; the hidden units of the first-level RBM serves\\nas the visible units for the second-layer RBM, and so on. Such an RBM stack is called\\na deep belief net (DBN).\\nYee-Whye Teh, one of Geoffrey Hinton’s students, observed that it was possible to\\ntrain DBNs one layer at a time using Contrastive Divergence, starting with the lower\\nOther Popular ANN Architectures \\n| \\n519\\nDownload from finelybook www.finelybook.com'),\n",

This led to the groundbreaking\\narticle that kickstarted the Deep Learning tsunami in 2006.2\\nJust like RBMs, DBNs learn to reproduce the probability distribution of their inputs,\\nwithout any supervision.

Their lower lay‐\\ners learn low-level features in the input data, while higher layers learn high-level fea‐\\ntures.\\nJust like RBMs, DBNs are fundamentally unsupervised, but you can also train them\\nin a supervised manner by adding some visible units to represent the labels. More‐\\nover, one great feature of DBNs is that they can be trained in a semisupervised fash‐\\nion. Figure E-4 represents such a DBN configured for semisupervised learning.\\nFigure E-4.

It learns to associate high-level features with training labels. This is\\nthe supervised step.\\nAt the end of training, if you feed RBM 1 a new instance, the signal will propagate up\\nto RBM 2, then up to the top of RBM 3, and then back down to the label units; hope‐\\nfully, the appropriate label will light up. This is how a DBN can be used for classifica‐\\ntion.\\nOne great benefit of this semisupervised approach is that you don’t need much\\nlabeled training data. If the unsupervised RBMs do a good enough job, then only a\\nsmall amount of labeled training instances per class will be necessary. Similarly, a\\nbaby learns to recognize objects without supervision, so when you point to a chair\\nand say “chair,” the baby can associate the word “chair” with the class of objects it has\\nalready learned to recognize on its own. You don’t need to point to every single chair\\nand say “chair”; only a few examples will suffice (just enough so the baby can be sure\\nthat you are indeed referring to the chair, not to its color or one of the chair’s parts).\\nQuite amazingly, DBNs can also work in reverse. If you activate one of the label units,\\nthe signal will propagate up to the hidden units of RBM 3, then down to RBM 2, and\\nthen RBM 1, and a new instance will be output by the visible units of RBM 1. This\\nnew instance will usually look like a regular instance of the class whose label unit you\\nactivated. This generative capability of DBNs is quite powerful. For example, it has\\nbeen used to automatically generate captions for images, and vice versa: first a DBN is\\ntrained (without supervision) to learn features in images, and another DBN is trained\\n(again without supervision) to learn features in sets of captions (e.g., “car” often\\ncomes with “automobile”). Then an RBM is stacked on top of both DBNs and trained\\nwith a set of images along with their captions; it learns to associate high-level features\\nin images with high-level features in captions. Next, if you feed the image DBN an\\nimage of a car, the signal will propagate through the network, up to the top-level\\nRBM, and back down to the bottom of the caption DBN, producing a caption. Due to\\nthe stochastic nature of RBMs and DBNs, the caption will keep changing randomly,\\nbut it will generally be appropriate for the image. If you generate a few hundred cap‐\\ntions, the most frequently generated ones will likely be a good description of the\\nimage.3\\nSelf-Organizing Maps\\nSelf-organizing maps (SOM) are quite different from all the other types of neural net‐\\nworks we have discussed so far.

A former Googler, he led the You‐\\nTube video classification team from 2013 to 2016. He was also a founder and CTO of\\nWifirst from 2002 to 2012, a leading Wireless ISP in France; and a founder and CTO\\nof Polyconseil in 2001, the firm that now manages the electric car sharing service\\nAutolib’.\\nBefore this he worked as an engineer in a variety of domains: finance (JP Morgan and\\nSociété Générale), defense (Canada’s DOD), and healthcare (blood transfusion). He\\npublished a few technical books (on C++, WiFi, and internet architectures), and was\\na Computer Science lecturer in a French engineering school.\\nA few fun facts: he taught his three children to count in binary with their fingers (up\\nto 1023), he studied microbiology and evolutionary genetics before going into soft‐\\nware engineering, and his parachute didn’t open on the second jump.\\nColophon\\nThe animal on the cover of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Ten‐\\nsorFlow is the far eastern fire salamander (Salamandra infraimmaculata), an amphib‐\\nian found in the Middle East. They have black skin featuring large yellow spots on\\ntheir back and head. These spots are a warning coloration meant to keep predators at\\nbay. Full-grown salamanders can be over a foot in length.\\nFar eastern fire salamanders live in subtropical shrubland and forests near rivers or\\nother freshwater bodies. They spend most of their life on land, but lay their eggs in\\nthe water. They subsist mostly on a diet of insects, worms, and small crustaceans, but\\noccasionally eat other salamanders. Males of the species have been known to live up\\nto 23 years, while females can live up to 21 years.\\nAlthough not yet endangered, the far eastern fire salamander population is in decline.\\nPrimary threats include damming of rivers (which disrupts the salamander’s breed‐\\ning) and pollution. They are also threatened by the recent introduction of predatory\\nfish, such as the mosquitofish. These fish were intended to control the mosquito pop‐\\nulation, but they also feed on young salamanders.\\nMany of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to\\nthe world.
